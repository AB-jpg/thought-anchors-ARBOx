    "rollout": " So each digit in a base 7 number can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\nNow, the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers. Since 343 is 7 cubed (7^3), that makes sense because in base 7, the numbers from 1 up to 343 (which is 1000 in base 7) would be all the 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers in base 7. So, we're dealing with numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which is from 1 to 1000 in base 7.\n\nBut wait, actually, the number 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, so the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be from 1 (which is 1 in base 7) up to 666 in base 7, right? Because 666 in base 7 is 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342 in base 10. Then the next number is 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in base 10.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers\", so that would be from 1 to 343 inclusive in base 10. So in base 7, these numbers would range from 1 up to 1000 (base 7). So, we're considering all 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers in base 7, including 1000, which is 343 in base 10.\n\nWait, but 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, so that's included. So, we're looking at numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which is 1 to 1000 in base 7. Now, we need to count how many of these numbers, when written in base 7, have at least one digit that is 4 or 5. So, the problem is asking for the count of numbers in base 7 (from 1 to 1000) that have either a 4, a 5, or both in their digits.\n\nI think the standard way to approach this is to calculate the total number of numbers and subtract those that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit. So, using complementary counting. That is, total numbers minus numbers with no 4s and no 5s.\n\nSo, total numbers: 343. Now, how many numbers in base 7 from 1 to 1000 (base 7) don't have any 4 or 5 in their digits? Let's think about that.\n\nIn base 7, each digit can be 0-6. But since we're excluding 4 and 5, each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. So, 5 choices for each digit. However, we have to be careful because the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 correspond to 1 to 1000 in base 7, so we have 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers in base 7.\n\nWait, but in base 7, the number 1000 is included, right? So, let me think about how many digits each number has in base 7.\n\n- 1-digit numbers: 1 to 6 in base 7, which is 1 to 6 in base 10.\n- 2-digit numbers: 7 to 48 in base 10, since 10 in base 7 is 7 in base 10, and 66 in base 7 is 6*7 + 6 = 48 in base 10.\n- 3-digit numbers: 49 to 342 in base 10, since 100 in base 7 is 49 in base 10, and 666 in base 7 is 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 342 in base 10.\n- And then 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7.\n\nSo, when considering the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, we have 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers in base 7, plus the 4-digit number 1000.\n\nBut wait, 1000 in base 7 is a 4-digit number, so maybe it's better to consider all numbers as 3-digit numbers by padding with leading zeros. But wait, leading zeros aren't actually part of the number, so maybe it's better to consider numbers with 1, 2, or 3 digits in base 7.\n\nWait, but when calculating the count of numbers without 4 or 5, maybe it's easier to consider each digit position separately, allowing for leading zeros, and then subtract 1 if necessary because leading zeros aren't counted in actual numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, allowing leading zeros, so that each number is represented as ABC where A, B, C are digits from 0 to 6, and A can be zero. Then, the total number of 3-digit numbers in base 7 (including leading zeros) would be 7^3 = 343, which matches our total count. But in reality, numbers less than 100 in base 7 (i.e., less than 49 in base 10) would have leading zeros when considered as 3-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but in reality, numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 include numbers with 1, 2, and 3 digits in base 7. So, perhaps it's better to model each number as a 3-digit base 7 number with leading zeros allowed, so that each number from 000 to 666 in base 7 corresponds to 0 to 342 in base 10, and then 1000 in base 7 is 343. But since we're starting from 1, maybe we should consider numbers from 001 to 1000 in base 7, which is 1 to 343 in base 10.\n\nWait, but if we model each number as a 3-digit base 7 number, including leading zeros, then the total number of such numbers is 7^3 = 343, which are from 000 to 666 in base 7, corresponding to 0 to 342 in base 10. Then, 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which is a 4-digit number. Hmm, this might complicate things because 1000 is a 4-digit number, but perhaps it's better to include it as a separate case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model all numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7, which is 0 to 342 in base 10, and then add 1000 in base 7 (343 in base 10) separately. But since 343 is just one number, maybe we can handle it as a special case.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which are 1 to 343 in base 10. So, in base 7, these correspond to 1 to 1000 in base 7. So, 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, so that's included. So, when considering numbers from 1 to 1000 in base 7, how do we count the number of digits?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, with leading zeros allowed, so that each number from 000 to 666 in base 7 is considered, which is 0 to 342 in base 10, and then 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10. So, if I model all numbers as 3-digit base 7 numbers, including leading zeros, then each digit can be 0-6, and the total is 7^3 = 343 numbers, which correspond to 0 to 342 in base 10. Then, 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which is a 4-digit number. So, maybe I should handle 1000 separately.\n\nWait, but 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, and it's the only 4-digit number in our range. So, perhaps I can calculate the count for 3-digit numbers (000 to 666 in base 7) and then add 1 if 1000 in base 7 meets the condition (i.e., contains 4 or 5).\n\nBut let's first calculate how many 3-digit base 7 numbers (including leading zeros) don't have any 4 or 5. Then, we can adjust for the fact that we're starting from 1, not 0.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to model it as 3-digit numbers with leading zeros allowed, so each number is ABC, where A, B, C are digits from 0 to 6. Then, the total number is 343, which matches our total count from 0 to 342 in base 10. Then, we can calculate how many of these 343 numbers (including 000) don't have any 4 or 5, and then subtract that from 343 to get the count of numbers that do have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nBut since we're only interested in positive integers from 1 to 343, we need to make sure we're not including 000, which is 0 in base 10. So, maybe it's better to adjust for that.\n\nWait, let me structure this:\n\nTotal numbers: 343 (from 1 to 343 in base 10).\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5 in their base 7 digits: Let's calculate this.\n\nEach digit in base 7 can be 0-6. Excluding 4 and 5, each digit has 5 choices: 0,1,2,3,6.\n\nBut for numbers with leading zeros, which we're considering as 3-digit numbers, each digit has 5 choices.\n\nSo, the number of 3-digit base 7 numbers without any 4 or 5 is 5 * 5 * 5 = 125.\n\nBut wait, that includes the number 000, which is 0 in base 10. Since we're only considering positive integers from 1 to 343, we need to subtract 1 (the 000 case) to get the count of numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10 that don't have 4 or 5 in their digits. Then, we need to check if 343 in base 10 (1000 in base 7) has any 4 or 5.\n\nWait, 1000 in base 7 is '1', '0', '0', '0', so it doesn't have any 4 or 5. So, when considering 1 to 343 in base 10, the count of numbers without 4 or 5 is 125 (from 000 to 666 in base 7, without 4 or 5) minus 1 (for 000) plus 1 if 1000 in base 7 doesn't have 4 or 5, which it doesn't. Wait, no, because 1000 in base 7 is outside the 000-666 range, so we have to consider it separately.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit in base 7.\n\nLet me think of each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, allowing leading zeros, so from 000 to 666, which is 0 to 342 in base 10. Then, 343 is 1000 in base 7.\n\nSo, the number of 3-digit numbers without 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125, including 000. So, from 000 to 666, 125 numbers don't have 4 or 5.\n\nBut since we're interested in numbers from 1 to 343, we need to consider:\n\n- Numbers from 001 to 666 in base 7 (which is 1 to 342 in base 10) that don't have 4 or 5: 125 - 1 = 124 (since 000 is excluded).\n\n- Then, check if 343 in base 10 (1000 in base 7) has 4 or 5. It doesn't, so we add 1 to the count of numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nWait, no, because 1000 in base 7 is a separate number. So, in total, numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 343 would be 124 (from 001 to 666) plus 1 (for 1000) = 125.\n\nWait, but 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, which is the last number in our range. So, the total numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 343 in base 10 is 125.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The total numbers without 4 or 5 in their base 7 digits, from 000 to 666 (base 7) is 125. That includes 000. So, from 001 to 666, it's 125 - 1 = 124 numbers without 4 or 5. Then, 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10 and it doesn't have 4 or 5, so we add 1, making it 125 numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 343 in base 10.\n\nTherefore, the total numbers that do have at least one 4 or 5 is 343 (total numbers) minus 125 (without 4 or 5) = 218.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let's go through it again.\n\nTotal numbers: 343 (1 to 343 in base 10).\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5 in any digit in base 7: Each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6, so 5 choices per digit.\n\nIf we model each number as a 3-digit base 7 number with leading zeros, then the total number without 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125, including 000.\n\nBut since we're starting from 1, we need to subtract 1 for 000, giving 124 numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10 that don't have 4 or 5.\n\nThen, 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so we add 1, making it 125 numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 343.\n\nSo, total numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here because when considering numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which includes 1 to 342 and 343, the count without 4 or 5 is 125, so the count with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach is better. Let me consider each digit position separately.\n\nIn base 7, a 3-digit number can have digits A, B, C, each from 0 to 6. The number can't have leading zeros, but if we allow leading zeros, then each digit is independent.\n\nBut since we're considering numbers up to 3 digits, perhaps it's better to model each number as a 3-digit number with leading zeros, so from 000 to 666 in base 7, which is 0 to 342 in base 10, and then 343 is 1000 in base 7.\n\nSo, for numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7, the number without 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125, as before.\n\nNow, in our problem, we're considering numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which is 1 to 1000 in base 7.\n\nSo, in base 7, that's numbers from 001 to 1000.\n\nNow, the number 1000 in base 7 doesn't have any 4 or 5, so it's included in the count of numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nSo, the count of numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 343 in base 10 is:\n\n- From 001 to 666 in base 7: 125 (from 000 to 666) - 1 (for 000) = 124.\n\n- Then, 1000 in base 7: 1.\n\nTotal: 124 + 1 = 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another method.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 by considering each digit.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers in base 7 (including leading zeros), the total is 343.\n\nThe number without 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125.\n\nSo, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut since we're considering numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which includes 1 to 342 and 343, and 343 is 1000 in base 7 without any 4 or 5, so it's included in the 125 numbers without 4 or 5. Therefore, the count remains 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether 343 in base 10 is included in the count. Since 343 is 1000 in base 7 and it doesn't have any 4 or 5, it's part of the 125 numbers without 4 or 5. So, our calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 218.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step.\n\nWait, another way: For each digit position (hundreds, tens, units in base 7), calculate how many numbers have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but that might be more complicated, so perhaps the complementary counting is better",
    "full_cot": "Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 or both. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. First, base 7 numbers. Base 7 digits go from 0 to 6, right? So each digit in a base 7 number can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\nNow, the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers. Since 343 is 7 cubed (7^3), that makes sense because in base 7, the numbers from 1 up to 343 (which is 1000 in base 7) would be all the 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers in base 7.

Because 666 in base 7 is 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342 in base 10. Then the next number is 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in base 10.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers\", so that would be from 1 to 343 inclusive in base 10. So in base 7, these numbers would range from 1 up to 1000 (base 7). So, we're considering all 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers in base 7, including 1000, which is 343 in base 10.\n\nWait, but 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, so that's included. So, we're looking at numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which is 1 to 1000 in base 7. Now, we need to count how many of these numbers, when written in base 7, have at least one digit that is 4 or 5.

So, using complementary counting. That is, total numbers minus numbers with no 4s and no 5s.\n\nSo, total numbers: 343. Now, how many numbers in base 7 from 1 to 1000 (base 7) don't have any 4 or 5 in their digits? Let's think about that.\n\nIn base 7, each digit can be 0-6. But since we're excluding 4 and 5, each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. So, 5 choices for each digit. However, we have to be careful because the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 correspond to 1 to 1000 in base 7, so we have 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers in base 7.\n\nWait, but in base 7, the number 1000 is included, right? So, let me think about how many digits each number has in base 7.\n\n- 1-digit numbers: 1 to 6 in base 7, which is 1 to 6 in base 10.\n- 2-digit numbers: 7 to 48 in base 10, since 10 in base 7 is 7 in base 10, and 66 in base 7 is 6*7 + 6 = 48 in base 10.\n- 3-digit numbers: 49 to 342 in base 10, since 100 in base 7 is 49 in base 10, and 666 in base 7 is 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 342 in base 10.\n- And then 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7.\n\nSo, when considering the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, we have 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers in base 7, plus the 4-digit number 1000.\n\nBut wait, 1000 in base 7 is a 4-digit number, so maybe it's better to consider all numbers as 3-digit numbers by padding with leading zeros. But wait, leading zeros aren't actually part of the number, so maybe it's better to consider numbers with 1, 2, or 3 digits in base 7.\n\nWait, but when calculating the count of numbers without 4 or 5, maybe it's easier to consider each digit position separately, allowing for leading zeros, and then subtract 1 if necessary because leading zeros aren't counted in actual numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, allowing leading zeros, so that each number is represented as ABC where A, B, C are digits from 0 to 6, and A can be zero.

But in reality, numbers less than 100 in base 7 (i.e., less than 49 in base 10) would have leading zeros when considered as 3-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but in reality, numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 include numbers with 1, 2, and 3 digits in base 7. So, perhaps it's better to model each number as a 3-digit base 7 number with leading zeros allowed, so that each number from 000 to 666 in base 7 corresponds to 0 to 342 in base 10, and then 1000 in base 7 is 343. But since we're starting from 1, maybe we should consider numbers from 001 to 1000 in base 7, which is 1 to 343 in base 10.\n\nWait, but if we model each number as a 3-digit base 7 number, including leading zeros, then the total number of such numbers is 7^3 = 343, which are from 000 to 666 in base 7, corresponding to 0 to 342 in base 10. Then, 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which is a 4-digit number. Hmm, this might complicate things because 1000 is a 4-digit number, but perhaps it's better to include it as a separate case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model all numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7, which is 0 to 342 in base 10, and then add 1000 in base 7 (343 in base 10) separately. But since 343 is just one number, maybe we can handle it as a special case.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which are 1 to 343 in base 10. So, in base 7, these correspond to 1 to 1000 in base 7. So, 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, so that's included. So, when considering numbers from 1 to 1000 in base 7, how do we count the number of digits?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, with leading zeros allowed, so that each number from 000 to 666 in base 7 is considered, which is 0 to 342 in base 10, and then 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10. So, if I model all numbers as 3-digit base 7 numbers, including leading zeros, then each digit can be 0-6, and the total is 7^3 = 343 numbers, which correspond to 0 to 342 in base 10. Then, 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which is a 4-digit number. So, maybe I should handle 1000 separately.\n\nWait, but 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, and it's the only 4-digit number in our range. So, perhaps I can calculate the count for 3-digit numbers (000 to 666 in base 7) and then add 1 if 1000 in base 7 meets the condition (i.e., contains 4 or 5).\n\nBut let's first calculate how many 3-digit base 7 numbers (including leading zeros) don't have any 4 or 5. Then, we can adjust for the fact that we're starting from 1, not 0.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to model it as 3-digit numbers with leading zeros allowed, so each number is ABC, where A, B, C are digits from 0 to 6. Then, the total number is 343, which matches our total count from 0 to 342 in base 10. Then, we can calculate how many of these 343 numbers (including 000) don't have any 4 or 5, and then subtract that from 343 to get the count of numbers that do have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nBut since we're only interested in positive integers from 1 to 343, we need to make sure we're not including 000, which is 0 in base 10. So, maybe it's better to adjust for that.\n\nWait, let me structure this:\n\nTotal numbers: 343 (from 1 to 343 in base 10).\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5 in their base 7 digits: Let's calculate this.\n\nEach digit in base 7 can be 0-6. Excluding 4 and 5, each digit has 5 choices: 0,1,2,3,6.\n\nBut for numbers with leading zeros, which we're considering as 3-digit numbers, each digit has 5 choices.\n\nSo, the number of 3-digit base 7 numbers without any 4 or 5 is 5 * 5 * 5 = 125.\n\nBut wait, that includes the number 000, which is 0 in base 10. Since we're only considering positive integers from 1 to 343, we need to subtract 1 (the 000 case) to get the count of numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10 that don't have 4 or 5 in their digits. Then, we need to check if 343 in base 10 (1000 in base 7) has any 4 or 5.\n\nWait, 1000 in base 7 is '1', '0', '0', '0', so it doesn't have any 4 or 5. So, when considering 1 to 343 in base 10, the count of numbers without 4 or 5 is 125 (from 000 to 666 in base 7, without 4 or 5) minus 1 (for 000) plus 1 if 1000 in base 7 doesn't have 4 or 5, which it doesn't. Wait, no, because 1000 in base 7 is outside the 000-666 range, so we have to consider it separately.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit in base 7.\n\nLet me think of each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, allowing leading zeros, so from 000 to 666, which is 0 to 342 in base 10. Then, 343 is 1000 in base 7.\n\nSo, the number of 3-digit numbers without 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125, including 000. So, from 000 to 666, 125 numbers don't have 4 or 5.\n\nBut since we're interested in numbers from 1 to 343, we need to consider:\n\n- Numbers from 001 to 666 in base 7 (which is 1 to 342 in base 10) that don't have 4 or 5: 125 - 1 = 124 (since 000 is excluded).\n\n- Then, check if 343 in base 10 (1000 in base 7) has 4 or 5. It doesn't, so we add 1 to the count of numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nWait, no, because 1000 in base 7 is a separate number. So, in total, numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 343 would be 124 (from 001 to 666) plus 1 (for 1000) = 125.\n\nWait, but 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, which is the last number in our range. So, the total numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 343 in base 10 is 125.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The total numbers without 4 or 5 in their base 7 digits, from 000 to 666 (base 7) is 125. That includes 000. So, from 001 to 666, it's 125 - 1 = 124 numbers without 4 or 5. Then, 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10 and it doesn't have 4 or 5, so we add 1, making it 125 numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 343 in base 10.\n\nTherefore, the total numbers that do have at least one 4 or 5 is 343 (total numbers) minus 125 (without 4 or 5) = 218.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let's go through it again.\n\nTotal numbers: 343 (1 to 343 in base 10).\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5 in any digit in base 7: Each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6, so 5 choices per digit.\n\nIf we model each number as a 3-digit base 7 number with leading zeros, then the total number without 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125, including 000.\n\nBut since we're starting from 1, we need to subtract 1 for 000, giving 124 numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10 that don't have 4 or 5.\n\nThen, 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so we add 1, making it 125 numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 343.\n\nSo, total numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here because when considering numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which includes 1 to 342 and 343, the count without 4 or 5 is 125, so the count with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach is better. Let me consider each digit position separately.\n\nIn base 7, a 3-digit number can have digits A, B, C, each from 0 to 6. The number can't have leading zeros, but if we allow leading zeros, then each digit is independent.\n\nBut since we're considering numbers up to 3 digits, perhaps it's better to model each number as a 3-digit number with leading zeros, so from 000 to 666 in base 7, which is 0 to 342 in base 10, and then 343 is 1000 in base 7.\n\nSo, for numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7, the number without 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125, as before.\n\nNow, in our problem, we're considering numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which is 1 to 1000 in base 7.\n\nSo, in base 7, that's numbers from 001 to 1000.\n\nNow, the number 1000 in base 7 doesn't have any 4 or 5, so it's included in the count of numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nSo, the count of numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 343 in base 10 is:\n\n- From 001 to 666 in base 7: 125 (from 000 to 666) - 1 (for 000) = 124.\n\n- Then, 1000 in base 7: 1.\n\nTotal: 124 + 1 = 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another method.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 by considering each digit.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers in base 7 (including leading zeros), the total is 343.\n\nThe number without 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125.\n\nSo, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut since we're considering numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which includes 1 to 342 and 343, and 343 is 1000 in base 7 without any 4 or 5, so it's included in the 125 numbers without 4 or 5. Therefore, the count remains 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether 343 in base 10 is included in the count. Since 343 is 1000 in base 7 and it doesn't have any 4 or 5, it's part of the 125 numbers without 4 or 5. So, our calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 218.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step.\n\nWait, another way: For each digit position (hundreds, tens, units in base 7), calculate how many numbers have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but that might be more complicated, so perhaps the complementary counting is better",

Since 343 is 7 cubed, that makes me think that these numbers go up to three digits in base 7. Because in base 7, the number 343 would be represented as 1000_7, right? So the numbers from 1 up to 342 in base 7 are all the three-digit numbers and below in base 7. So I can consider all numbers from 000_7 up to 666_7 in base 7, but since we're talking about positive integers, maybe starting from 001_7 up to 666_7? Wait, but 666_7 is actually equal to 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 342 in decimal, so yeah, 342 is the last number before 343, which is 1000_7.\n\nSo, the problem is asking how many of these numbers (from 1 to 342 in decimal, which are 1 to 666 in base 7) have at least one digit that is 4 or 5. So, it's like a counting problem where I need to count how many numbers in base 7 up to three digits have at least one 4 or 5 in their digits.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. So, first, I can calculate the total number of numbers we're considering, which is 343 (from 1 to 343), but wait, no, because 343 is 1000_7, which isn't included since we're only considering up to 342. So actually, it's 342 numbers, but wait, 000_7 is 0, which isn't positive, so maybe from 1 to 342, which is 342 numbers. But the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which would be from 1 to 343, but 343 is 1000_7, which is a four-digit number. So, perhaps the 343 numbers are from 1 to 343, but in base 7, numbers up to three digits (since 343 is the next number after 666_7). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, 343 is 7^3, so the numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal correspond to numbers from 1_7 up to 1000_7 in base 7. So the 343 numbers are 1 to 343, inclusive. So in base 7, numbers from 1_7 up to 1000_7. So the numbers with up to three digits in base 7, and the number 1000_7 itself, which is four digits. But the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" so that would be 1 to 343. So when written in base 7, they can be one, two, three, or four digits. Wait, but 1000_7 is 343 in decimal, so it's included. So the numbers in base 7 would range from 1_7 (which is 1 in decimal) up to 1000_7 (which is 343 in decimal). So the total count is 343 numbers.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7,\" so perhaps they are considering numbers from 1 to 343 in base 7, which would be up to four digits. But that complicates things because 1000_7 is a four-digit number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering numbers up to three digits in base 7, so 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, but excluding 000_7, so 342 numbers. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the 343 numbers are the numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, written in base 7, and we need to count how many of those have at least one digit as 4 or 5. So, the approach would be to consider all numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, which in base 7 can be one, two, three, or four digits. But 343 in decimal is 1000_7, so that's a four-digit number. So, the numbers we're considering in base 7 can have 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits. Wait, but 1-digit numbers in base 7 go up to 6, which is 6 in decimal. 2-digit numbers go up to 66_7, which is 6*7 + 6 = 48 in decimal. 3-digit numbers go up to 666_7, which is 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 342 in decimal. Then 4-digit numbers start at 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal. So the 343 numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal include all numbers up to 342 in base 7 (three digits) and the number 343, which is 1000_7.\n\nSo, to count how many numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal have at least one digit as 4 or 5 in their base 7 representation, I can approach this by considering all possible base 7 numbers up to four digits (since 1000_7 is four digits) and count how many have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the total numbers without any 4 or 5 and subtract that from the total. So, the total numbers are 343. The numbers without any 4 or 5 would be numbers where each digit is only 0,1,2,3,6. Wait, but in base 7, the digits can be 0 to 6, so if we exclude 4 and 5, the allowed digits are 0,1,2,3,6. So, for each digit, we have 5 choices. But wait, the number 1000_7 is 343, which is a four-digit number, so we need to consider numbers with 1,2,3,4 digits in base 7.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to consider numbers with up to three digits in base 7, and then include the number 1000_7 separately. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which are 343 numbers, but since we're considering positive integers, maybe from 001_7 to 666_7, which is 342 numbers. But the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" which would be 1 to 343, so including 343, which is 1000_7. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider all numbers from 0 to 342 in decimal, which are exactly the numbers from 000_7 to 666_7 in base 7, and then add 1 to include 343, which is 1000_7. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can model all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then adjust for the fact that we're only considering positive integers, so excluding 000_7, giving 342 numbers. Then, perhaps, 343 is a separate case, but 343 is 1000_7, which has a 1 followed by three zeros, so it doesn't have any 4 or 5. So, in that case, the total numbers to consider would be 343, but the number 343 itself (1000_7) doesn't have a 4 or 5, so perhaps the count is the same as in 1 to 342.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that in base 7, each number can be represented as a three-digit number by padding with leading zeros. So, for example, the number 1 in base 7 is 001_7, 7 is 010_7, and so on up to 342, which is 666_7. Then, the number 343 is 1000_7, which is four digits. So, the 343 numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal correspond to numbers from 001_7 to 1000_7 in base 7.\n\nBut to make it manageable, perhaps I can calculate how many three-digit base 7 numbers (including leading zeros) have at least one digit as 4 or 5, and then add 1 if 1000_7 has 4 or 5, which it doesn't. So, the total numbers with at least one 4 or 5 would be the count among the three-digit numbers plus zero for 1000_7.\n\nWait, but 343 numbers include 1000_7, which is four digits, so maybe I should consider four-digit numbers as well. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, and count how many of their base 7 representations contain at least one 4 or 5.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model all numbers as three-digit numbers in base 7, including leading zeros, so from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers. Then, since we're interested in the numbers from 1 to 343, which includes 001_7 to 666_7 (342 numbers) plus 1000_7 (343). But 1000_7 doesn't have any 4 or 5, so the count would be the same as from 001_7 to 666_7.\n\nSo, if I can find how many three-digit base 7 numbers (including leading zeros) have at least one digit as 4 or 5, that would give me the count from 1 to 342, and then I can check if 343 (1000_7) adds anything, which it doesn't because it doesn't have 4 or 5.\n\nSo, to find how many three-digit base 7 numbers have at least one digit as 4 or 5, I can use inclusion-exclusion. The total number of three-digit numbers in base 7 is 7^3 = 343. But wait, including 000_7, which is 0. Since we're considering positive integers, maybe we should exclude 000_7, so 342 numbers. But perhaps it's easier to include 000_7 and then subtract it later if necessary.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the 343 smallest positive integers, which are 1 to 343. So, in base 7, that's 001_7 to 1000_7. So, perhaps I can model it as numbers from 000_7 to 666_7 (343 numbers) and then adjust for the fact that 000_7 isn't included, but 1000_7 is. Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should just consider all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract the count for 000_7 if necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of three-digit base 7 numbers (including leading zeros) that have at least one digit as 4 or 5, and then add 1 if 1000_7 has 4 or 5, which it doesn't. So, the total would be the count for three-digit numbers plus 0.\n\nSo, how many three-digit base 7 numbers have at least one digit as 4 or 5? To find this, it's easier to calculate the total number of three-digit numbers minus the number of three-digit numbers that have no 4 or 5 in any digit.\n\nSo, total three-digit numbers in base 7: 7^3 = 343.\n\nNumber of three-digit numbers with no 4 or 5: Each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. So, for each digit, there are 5 choices. But wait, in three-digit numbers, the first digit can be 0? Wait, no, because if we're considering three-digit numbers with leading zeros, then each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. So, for each of the three digits, we have 5 choices. So, the number of three-digit numbers without any 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125.\n\nWait, but that includes 000_7, which is 0, but we're interested in positive integers from 1 to 343. So, the number of positive integers without any 4 or 5 would be 125 - 1 = 124, because 000_7 is excluded.\n\nBut wait, 5^3 = 125 includes all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7 that don't have 4 or 5. So, the count of numbers without 4 or 5 is 125. But since we're considering positive integers from 1 to 343, which includes 001_7 to 666_7 and 1000_7, which is 343 numbers. So, the count of numbers without 4 or 5 would be 125 (from 000_7 to 666_7) minus 1 (excluding 000_7), so 124 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but 1000_7 is 343, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so we need to include that as well. So, total numbers without 4 or 5 would be 124 (from 1 to 342) plus 1 (343), so 125.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Let me think again.\n\nIf I consider all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, the number without any 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125. But in this range, 000_7 is included, which is 0. So, the numbers from 1 to 342 (342 numbers) in decimal correspond to 001_7 to 666_7 in base 7. So, the number of numbers without any 4 or 5 in this range is 125 - 1 = 124, because 000_7 is excluded. Then, 343 is 1000_7, which is another number without 4 or 5, so total numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 343 would be 124 + 1 = 125.\n\nTherefore, the total numbers without any 4 or 5 in their base 7 digits from 1 to 343 is 125. Therefore, the numbers that do have at least one 4 or 5 would be total numbers (343) minus numbers without 4 or 5 (125), so 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. So, numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal. When converted to base 7, they range from 1_7 to 1000_7. So, the total count is 343 numbers.\n\nThe number of numbers without any 4 or 5 in base 7 would be:\n\nFor each digit, we have 5 choices (0,1,2,3,6). But in three-digit numbers, leading zeros are allowed, so each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6, giving 5^3 = 125 numbers from 000_7 to 666_7 that don't have 4 or 5. But since we're considering positive integers from 1 to 343, we need to adjust this count.\n\nFrom 001_7 to 666_7, which is 342 numbers, the count without 4 or 5 is 125 - 1 = 124 (excluding 000_7). Then, 343 is 1000_7, which also doesn't have 4 or 5, so total numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 343 is 124 + 1 = 125. Therefore, the numbers with at least one 4 or 5 would be 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer would be 218.\n\nBut let me verify this with another approach to be sure.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 in their base 7 digits.\n\nWe can think of each digit as having 7 possibilities, but we want to count how many have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, using inclusion-exclusion, the number of numbers with at least one 4 is equal to total numbers minus numbers without any 4s. Similarly for 5. But since we want numbers with at least one 4 or 5, it's better to calculate it as total minus numbers without 4 and without 5.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, total numbers: 343. Numbers without 4 or 5: 125. Therefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each digit can be 4 or 5, and calculate the number of numbers with at least one such digit, it's the same as total minus numbers without any 4 or 5.\n\nSo, I think 218 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake with the digits.\n\nIn base 7, each digit can be from 0 to 6. So, for each digit, the number of digits that are not 4 or 5 is 5 (0,1,2,3,6). So, for a three-digit number, the number without any 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125, as I calculated before. But in our case, the numbers go up to four digits (1000_7). So, does that affect the count?\n\nWait, 1000_7 is a four-digit number, but it doesn't have any 4 or 5, so when I calculated the numbers without 4 or 5, I included 1000_7 as part of the 125. But wait, in the range from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, the numbers without 4 or 5 are 125, which includes 000_7. So, from 1 to 343, it's 125 - 1 + 1 = 125, because we exclude 000_7 and include 1000_7. So, that part checks out.\n\nTherefore, the count of numbers with at least one 4 or",

Problem: How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 or both. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. First, base 7 numbers. Base 7 digits go from 0 to 6, right? So each digit in a base 7 number can be 0,1,2,3,4,5, or 6.\n\nNow, the problem is about the 343 smallest positive integers. Since 343 is 7 cubed, that makes me think that these numbers go up to three digits in base 7. Because in base 7, the number 343 would be represented as 1000_7, right? So the numbers from 1 up to 342 in base 7 are all the three-digit numbers and below in base 7.

Wait, but 666_7 is actually equal to 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 342 in decimal, so yeah, 342 is the last number before 343, which is 1000_7.\n\nSo, the problem is asking how many of these numbers (from 1 to 342 in decimal, which are 1 to 666 in base 7) have at least one digit that is 4 or 5. So, it's like a counting problem where I need to count how many numbers in base 7 up to three digits have at least one 4 or 5 in their digits.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. So, first, I can calculate the total number of numbers we're considering, which is 343 (from 1 to 343), but wait, no, because 343 is 1000_7, which isn't included since we're only considering up to 342. So actually, it's 342 numbers, but wait, 000_7 is 0, which isn't positive, so maybe from 1 to 342, which is 342 numbers. But the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which would be from 1 to 343, but 343 is 1000_7, which is a four-digit number. So, perhaps the 343 numbers are from 1 to 343, but in base 7, numbers up to three digits (since 343 is the next number after 666_7). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, 343 is 7^3, so the numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal correspond to numbers from 1_7 up to 1000_7 in base 7. So the 343 numbers are 1 to 343, inclusive. So in base 7, numbers from 1_7 up to 1000_7. So the numbers with up to three digits in base 7, and the number 1000_7 itself, which is four digits. But the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" so that would be 1 to 343. So when written in base 7, they can be one, two, three, or four digits. Wait, but 1000_7 is 343 in decimal, so it's included. So the numbers in base 7 would range from 1_7 (which is 1 in decimal) up to 1000_7 (which is 343 in decimal). So the total count is 343 numbers.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7,\" so perhaps they are considering numbers from 1 to 343 in base 7, which would be up to four digits. But that complicates things because 1000_7 is a four-digit number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering numbers up to three digits in base 7, so 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, but excluding 000_7, so 342 numbers. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the 343 numbers are the numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, written in base 7, and we need to count how many of those have at least one digit as 4 or 5. So, the approach would be to consider all numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, which in base 7 can be one, two, three, or four digits. But 343 in decimal is 1000_7, so that's a four-digit number. So, the numbers we're considering in base 7 can have 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits. Wait, but 1-digit numbers in base 7 go up to 6, which is 6 in decimal. 2-digit numbers go up to 66_7, which is 6*7 + 6 = 48 in decimal. 3-digit numbers go up to 666_7, which is 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 342 in decimal. Then 4-digit numbers start at 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal. So the 343 numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal include all numbers up to 342 in base 7 (three digits) and the number 343, which is 1000_7.\n\nSo, to count how many numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal have at least one digit as 4 or 5 in their base 7 representation, I can approach this by considering all possible base 7 numbers up to four digits (since 1000_7 is four digits) and count how many have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the total numbers without any 4 or 5 and subtract that from the total. So, the total numbers are 343. The numbers without any 4 or 5 would be numbers where each digit is only 0,1,2,3,6. Wait, but in base 7, the digits can be 0 to 6, so if we exclude 4 and 5, the allowed digits are 0,1,2,3,6. So, for each digit, we have 5 choices. But wait, the number 1000_7 is 343, which is a four-digit number, so we need to consider numbers with 1,2,3,4 digits in base 7.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to consider numbers with up to three digits in base 7, and then include the number 1000_7 separately. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which are 343 numbers, but since we're considering positive integers, maybe from 001_7 to 666_7, which is 342 numbers. But the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" which would be 1 to 343, so including 343, which is 1000_7. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider all numbers from 0 to 342 in decimal, which are exactly the numbers from 000_7 to 666_7 in base 7, and then add 1 to include 343, which is 1000_7. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can model all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then adjust for the fact that we're only considering positive integers, so excluding 000_7, giving 342 numbers. Then, perhaps, 343 is a separate case, but 343 is 1000_7, which has a 1 followed by three zeros, so it doesn't have any 4 or 5. So, in that case, the total numbers to consider would be 343, but the number 343 itself (1000_7) doesn't have a 4 or 5, so perhaps the count is the same as in 1 to 342.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that in base 7, each number can be represented as a three-digit number by padding with leading zeros. So, for example, the number 1 in base 7 is 001_7, 7 is 010_7, and so on up to 342, which is 666_7. Then, the number 343 is 1000_7, which is four digits. So, the 343 numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal correspond to numbers from 001_7 to 1000_7 in base 7.\n\nBut to make it manageable, perhaps I can calculate how many three-digit base 7 numbers (including leading zeros) have at least one digit as 4 or 5, and then add 1 if 1000_7 has 4 or 5, which it doesn't. So, the total numbers with at least one 4 or 5 would be the count among the three-digit numbers plus zero for 1000_7.\n\nWait, but 343 numbers include 1000_7, which is four digits, so maybe I should consider four-digit numbers as well. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, and count how many of their base 7 representations contain at least one 4 or 5.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model all numbers as three-digit numbers in base 7, including leading zeros, so from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers. Then, since we're interested in the numbers from 1 to 343, which includes 001_7 to 666_7 (342 numbers) plus 1000_7 (343). But 1000_7 doesn't have any 4 or 5, so the count would be the same as from 001_7 to 666_7.\n\nSo, if I can find how many three-digit base 7 numbers (including leading zeros) have at least one digit as 4 or 5, that would give me the count from 1 to 342, and then I can check if 343 (1000_7) adds anything, which it doesn't because it doesn't have 4 or 5.\n\nSo, to find how many three-digit base 7 numbers have at least one digit as 4 or 5, I can use inclusion-exclusion. The total number of three-digit numbers in base 7 is 7^3 = 343. But wait, including 000_7, which is 0. Since we're considering positive integers, maybe we should exclude 000_7, so 342 numbers. But perhaps it's easier to include 000_7 and then subtract it later if necessary.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the 343 smallest positive integers, which are 1 to 343. So, in base 7, that's 001_7 to 1000_7. So, perhaps I can model it as numbers from 000_7 to 666_7 (343 numbers) and then adjust for the fact that 000_7 isn't included, but 1000_7 is. Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should just consider all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract the count for 000_7 if necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of three-digit base 7 numbers (including leading zeros) that have at least one digit as 4 or 5, and then add 1 if 1000_7 has 4 or 5, which it doesn't. So, the total would be the count for three-digit numbers plus 0.\n\nSo, how many three-digit base 7 numbers have at least one digit as 4 or 5? To find this, it's easier to calculate the total number of three-digit numbers minus the number of three-digit numbers that have no 4 or 5 in any digit.\n\nSo, total three-digit numbers in base 7: 7^3 = 343.\n\nNumber of three-digit numbers with no 4 or 5: Each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. So, for each digit, there are 5 choices. But wait, in three-digit numbers, the first digit can be 0? Wait, no, because if we're considering three-digit numbers with leading zeros, then each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. So, for each of the three digits, we have 5 choices. So, the number of three-digit numbers without any 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125.\n\nWait, but that includes 000_7, which is 0, but we're interested in positive integers from 1 to 343. So, the number of positive integers without any 4 or 5 would be 125 - 1 = 124, because 000_7 is excluded.\n\nBut wait, 5^3 = 125 includes all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7 that don't have 4 or 5. So, the count of numbers without 4 or 5 is 125. But since we're considering positive integers from 1 to 343, which includes 001_7 to 666_7 and 1000_7, which is 343 numbers. So, the count of numbers without 4 or 5 would be 125 (from 000_7 to 666_7) minus 1 (excluding 000_7), so 124 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but 1000_7 is 343, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so we need to include that as well. So, total numbers without 4 or 5 would be 124 (from 1 to 342) plus 1 (343), so 125.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Let me think again.\n\nIf I consider all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, the number without any 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125. But in this range, 000_7 is included, which is 0. So, the numbers from 1 to 342 (342 numbers) in decimal correspond to 001_7 to 666_7 in base 7. So, the number of numbers without any 4 or 5 in this range is 125 - 1 = 124, because 000_7 is excluded. Then, 343 is 1000_7, which is another number without 4 or 5, so total numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 343 would be 124 + 1 = 125.\n\nTherefore, the total numbers without any 4 or 5 in their base 7 digits from 1 to 343 is 125. Therefore, the numbers that do have at least one 4 or 5 would be total numbers (343) minus numbers without 4 or 5 (125), so 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. So, numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal. When converted to base 7, they range from 1_7 to 1000_7. So, the total count is 343 numbers.\n\nThe number of numbers without any 4 or 5 in base 7 would be:\n\nFor each digit, we have 5 choices (0,1,2,3,6). But in three-digit numbers, leading zeros are allowed, so each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6, giving 5^3 = 125 numbers from 000_7 to 666_7 that don't have 4 or 5. But since we're considering positive integers from 1 to 343, we need to adjust this count.\n\nFrom 001_7 to 666_7, which is 342 numbers, the count without 4 or 5 is 125 - 1 = 124 (excluding 000_7). Then, 343 is 1000_7, which also doesn't have 4 or 5, so total numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 343 is 124 + 1 = 125. Therefore, the numbers with at least one 4 or 5 would be 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer would be 218.\n\nBut let me verify this with another approach to be sure.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 in their base 7 digits.\n\nWe can think of each digit as having 7 possibilities, but we want to count how many have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, using inclusion-exclusion, the number of numbers with at least one 4 is equal to total numbers minus numbers without any 4s. Similarly for 5. But since we want numbers with at least one 4 or 5, it's better to calculate it as total minus numbers without 4 and without 5.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, total numbers: 343. Numbers without 4 or 5: 125. Therefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each digit can be 4 or 5, and calculate the number of numbers with at least one such digit, it's the same as total minus numbers without any 4 or 5.\n\nSo, I think 218 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake with the digits.\n\nIn base 7, each digit can be from 0 to 6. So, for each digit, the number of digits that are not 4 or 5 is 5 (0,1,2,3,6). So, for a three-digit number, the number without any 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125, as I calculated before. But in our case, the numbers go up to four digits (1000_7). So, does that affect the count?\n\nWait, 1000_7 is a four-digit number, but it doesn't have any 4 or 5, so when I calculated the numbers without 4 or 5, I included 1000_7 as part of the 125. But wait, in the range from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, the numbers without 4 or 5 are 125, which includes 000_7. So, from 1 to 343, it's 125 - 1 + 1 = 125, because we exclude 000_7 and include 1000_7. So, that part checks out.\n\nTherefore, the count of numbers with at least one 4 or",

Wait, 343 in base 10 is actually 7^3, which is 1000 in base 7. So the numbers we're considering are from 1 up to 666 in base 7, because 666 base 7 is equal to 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342 in base 10. So the 343 numbers are from 1 to 342 in base 10, which correspond to 1 to 666 in base 7. Wait, but 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, so maybe the numbers go up to 666 base 7, which is 342 base 10. So 343 numbers in total, from 1 to 342 base 10, which are 1 to 666 in base 7.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many of these numbers, when written in base 7, have at least one digit that is 4 or 5, or both. So I need to count how many numbers in base 7 from 1 to 666 (base 7) have at least one digit as 4 or 5.\n\nMaybe it's easier to calculate the total number of numbers minus the number of numbers that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit. That is, use complementary counting. So total numbers = 343, as given. Then, the numbers that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit would have digits only from 0,1,2,3,6. So each digit can be one of 5 choices.\n\nBut wait, the numbers are from 1 to 666 in base 7, which is 1 to 342 in base 10. So how many digits do these numbers have in base 7? Let me see: 7^0 =1, 7^1=7, 7^2=49, 7^3=343. So numbers up to 342 base 10 are up to 666 base 7, which is a 3-digit number in base 7. So all numbers from 1 to 666 base 7 are either 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers in base 7.\n\nSo to count the numbers without any 4 or 5, I can consider each digit position separately. For 1-digit numbers, they can be 1,2,3,4,5,6 in base 7. But since we're excluding 4 and 5, the allowed digits are 1,2,3,6. So 4 choices. But wait, 0 isn't allowed in the units place for positive integers, right? So for 1-digit numbers, allowed digits are 1,2,3,6. So 4 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers in base 7: the first digit (7's place) can be 1,2,3,4,5,6, but without 4 or 5, so 1,2,3,6: 4 choices. The second digit (units place) can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, but without 4 or 5, so 0,1,2,3,6: 5 choices. So total 2-digit numbers without 4 or 5 are 4*5 =20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers in base 7: the first digit (49's place) can be 1,2,3,4,5,6, but without 4 or 5, so 1,2,3,6: 4 choices. The second digit (7's place) can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, but without 4 or 5, so 0,1,2,3,6: 5 choices. The third digit (units place) can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, but without 4 or 5, so 0,1,2,3,6: 5 choices. So total 3-digit numbers without 4 or 5 are 4*5*5=100.\n\nWait, but let me check: 4*5*5=100. So total numbers without 4 or 5 in any digit would be 1-digit (4) + 2-digit (20) + 3-digit (100) = 124.\n\nBut wait, let me check: 4 (1-digit) + 20 (2-digit) + 100 (3-digit) = 124. So total numbers without any 4 or 5 are 124. Therefore, numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 would be total numbers (343) minus 124, which is 219.\n\nWait, but hold on, does this include zero? Because when counting 1-digit numbers, we started from 1, not 0. So the numbers from 1 to 666 base 7 (which is 1 to 342 base 10) are 343 numbers. So subtracting 124 from 343 gives 219. So the answer should be 219.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFirst, total numbers: 343, correct.\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5:\n\n1-digit numbers: digits allowed are 1,2,3,6. So 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit: 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit: 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit:1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit:0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices), third digit:0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5*5=100.\n\nTotal without 4 or 5: 4+20+100=124.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343-124=219.\n\nWait, but let me check if the 3-digit numbers are correctly calculated. Since in base 7, the 3-digit numbers go from 100 base 7 (which is 49 in base 10) up to 666 base 7 (342 in base 10). So how many 3-digit numbers are there? From 100 to 666 base 7, which is 6*7^2 + 6*7 +6 - 100 +1? Wait, no, in base 7, the count is 6*7^2 +6*7 +6 - 100_base7 +1? Wait, perhaps it's better to think in base 10.\n\nWait, but in base 7, 100 is 49, and 666 is 342. So the number of 3-digit numbers in base 7 is 342 - 49 +1 = 294 numbers.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier calculation, the number of 3-digit numbers without 4 or 5 is 100. But 100 is more than 294? Wait, no, 100 is less than 294, so that seems okay.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of 3-digit numbers. Let me recalculate:\n\nIn base 7, 3-digit numbers start from 100_base7 (49 base10) up to 666_base7 (342 base10). So total 3-digit numbers in base7 is 342 -49 +1=294.\n\nNow, the number of 3-digit numbers without any 4 or 5 is 4*5*5=100, which is less than 294, so that seems okay.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct.\n\nThus, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 -124=219.\n\nWait, but let me check if the initial assumption that the numbers go up to 666_base7 is correct. Since 343 in base10 is 1000_base7, so the numbers from 1 to 342 base10 correspond to 1 to 666_base7. So yes, 343 numbers in total.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 219.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with digits, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me check the count again.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5:\n\n1-digit: 1,2,3,6 =>4 numbers.\n\n2-digit: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices), third digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5*5=100.\n\nTotal without 4 or5:4+20+100=124.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or5:343-124=219.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: for each digit position, calculate the number of numbers that have 4 or5 in that position, but this might get complicated because of overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using inclusion-exclusion, but that might be more complex. The complementary counting seems straightforward and gives 219.\n\nSo I think the answer is 219.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of integers is \\boxed{219}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit, we can use complementary counting.\n\n1. **Total Numbers**: The 343 smallest positive integers in base 10 correspond to the numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10, which are written as 1 to 666 in base 7.\n\n2. **Counting Numbers Without 4 or 5**:\n   - **1-digit numbers**: The allowed digits are 1, 2, 3, 6 (4 choices).\n   - **2-digit numbers**: The first digit (7's place) has 4 choices (1, 2, 3, 6), and the second digit (units place) has 5 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 6).

Problem: How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 or both. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. First, base 7 numbers. Base 7 digits go from 0 to 6, right? So each digit in a base 7 number can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. The 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be from 1 up to 343 in base 10, but written in base 7. Wait, 343 in base 10 is actually 7^3, which is 1000 in base 7. So the numbers we're considering are from 1 up to 666 in base 7, because 666 base 7 is equal to 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342 in base 10. So the 343 numbers are from 1 to 342 in base 10, which correspond to 1 to 666 in base 7. Wait, but 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, so maybe the numbers go up to 666 base 7, which is 342 base 10. So 343 numbers in total, from 1 to 342 base 10, which are 1 to 666 in base 7.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many of these numbers, when written in base 7, have at least one digit that is 4 or 5, or both. So I need to count how many numbers in base 7 from 1 to 666 (base 7) have at least one digit as 4 or 5.\n\nMaybe it's easier to calculate the total number of numbers minus the number of numbers that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit. That is, use complementary counting. So total numbers = 343, as given. Then, the numbers that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit would have digits only from 0,1,2,3,6. So each digit can be one of 5 choices.\n\nBut wait, the numbers are from 1 to 666 in base 7, which is 1 to 342 in base 10. So how many digits do these numbers have in base 7? Let me see: 7^0 =1, 7^1=7, 7^2=49, 7^3=343. So numbers up to 342 base 10 are up to 666 base 7, which is a 3-digit number in base 7. So all numbers from 1 to 666 base 7 are either 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers in base 7.\n\nSo to count the numbers without any 4 or 5, I can consider each digit position separately. For 1-digit numbers, they can be 1,2,3,4,5,6 in base 7. But since we're excluding 4 and 5, the allowed digits are 1,2,3,6. So 4 choices. But wait, 0 isn't allowed in the units place for positive integers, right? So for 1-digit numbers, allowed digits are 1,2,3,6. So 4 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers in base 7: the first digit (7's place) can be 1,2,3,4,5,6, but without 4 or 5, so 1,2,3,6: 4 choices. The second digit (units place) can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, but without 4 or 5, so 0,1,2,3,6: 5 choices. So total 2-digit numbers without 4 or 5 are 4*5 =20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers in base 7: the first digit (49's place) can be 1,2,3,4,5,6, but without 4 or 5, so 1,2,3,6: 4 choices. The second digit (7's place) can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, but without 4 or 5, so 0,1,2,3,6: 5 choices. The third digit (units place) can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, but without 4 or 5, so 0,1,2,3,6: 5 choices. So total 3-digit numbers without 4 or 5 are 4*5*5=100.\n\nWait, but let me check: 4*5*5=100. So total numbers without 4 or 5 in any digit would be 1-digit (4) + 2-digit (20) + 3-digit (100) = 124.\n\nBut wait, let me check: 4 (1-digit) + 20 (2-digit) + 100 (3-digit) = 124. So total numbers without any 4 or 5 are 124. Therefore, numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 would be total numbers (343) minus 124, which is 219.\n\nWait, but hold on, does this include zero? Because when counting 1-digit numbers, we started from 1, not 0. So the numbers from 1 to 666 base 7 (which is 1 to 342 base 10) are 343 numbers. So subtracting 124 from 343 gives 219. So the answer should be 219.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFirst, total numbers: 343, correct.\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5:\n\n1-digit numbers: digits allowed are 1,2,3,6. So 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit: 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit: 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit:1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit:0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices), third digit:0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5*5=100.\n\nTotal without 4 or 5: 4+20+100=124.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343-124=219.\n\nWait, but let me check if the 3-digit numbers are correctly calculated. Since in base 7, the 3-digit numbers go from 100 base 7 (which is 49 in base 10) up to 666 base 7 (342 in base 10). So how many 3-digit numbers are there? From 100 to 666 base 7, which is 6*7^2 + 6*7 +6 - 100 +1? Wait, no, in base 7, the count is 6*7^2 +6*7 +6 - 100_base7 +1? Wait, perhaps it's better to think in base 10.\n\nWait, but in base 7, 100 is 49, and 666 is 342. So the number of 3-digit numbers in base 7 is 342 - 49 +1 = 294 numbers.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier calculation, the number of 3-digit numbers without 4 or 5 is 100. But 100 is more than 294? Wait, no, 100 is less than 294, so that seems okay.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of 3-digit numbers. Let me recalculate:\n\nIn base 7, 3-digit numbers start from 100_base7 (49 base10) up to 666_base7 (342 base10). So total 3-digit numbers in base7 is 342 -49 +1=294.\n\nNow, the number of 3-digit numbers without any 4 or 5 is 4*5*5=100, which is less than 294, so that seems okay.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct.\n\nThus, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 -124=219.\n\nWait, but let me check if the initial assumption that the numbers go up to 666_base7 is correct. Since 343 in base10 is 1000_base7, so the numbers from 1 to 342 base10 correspond to 1 to 666_base7. So yes, 343 numbers in total.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 219.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with digits, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me check the count again.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5:\n\n1-digit: 1,2,3,6 =>4 numbers.\n\n2-digit: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices), third digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5*5=100.\n\nTotal without 4 or5:4+20+100=124.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or5:343-124=219.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: for each digit position, calculate the number of numbers that have 4 or5 in that position, but this might get complicated because of overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using inclusion-exclusion, but that might be more complex. The complementary counting seems straightforward and gives 219.\n\nSo I think the answer is 219.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of integers is \\boxed{219}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit, we can use complementary counting.\n\n1. **Total Numbers**: The 343 smallest positive integers in base 10 correspond to the numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10, which are written as 1 to 666 in base 7.\n\n2. **Counting Numbers Without 4 or 5**:\n   - **1-digit numbers**: The allowed digits are 1, 2, 3, 6 (4 choices).\n   - **2-digit numbers**: The first digit (7's place) has 4 choices (1, 2, 3, 6), and the second digit (units place) has 5 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 6).

So that means we're looking at all the numbers from 1 up to 343 in base 10, but converted to base 7. But actually, in base 7, the number 343 base 10 is 1000 base 7 because 7^3 is 343. So the numbers we are considering are all the base 7 numbers from 1 up to 666 base 7, because 666 base 7 is equal to 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 +6 = 294 + 42 +6= 342, and then 343 is 1000 base 7, which is beyond that. So, the numbers we are considering are all 1 to 666 base 7, which are the first 342 numbers in base 10, but the problem says 343 smallest positive integers. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 343 is 7^3, so in base 7, the numbers go up to 666 base 7, which is 342 in base 10, right? So the 343 numbers would be from 1 to 343 in base 10, but when converted to base 7, the last number is 1000 base 7. So, actually, the numbers in base 7 range from 1 (which is 1 base 7) up to 1000 base 7, which is 343 in base 10. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the problem is asking how many of these 343 numbers have at least one digit that is 4 or 5. So, in other words, among all the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, when written in base 7, how many have at least one 4 or 5 in their digits.\n\nI think the standard way to approach such problems is using complementary counting. That is, instead of counting the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5, we can count the total numbers and subtract those that have no 4s or 5s at all. So, total numbers are 343, and numbers with no 4s or 5s are those where each digit is only 0,1,2,3,6. So, let's compute that.\n\nBut wait, first, let me confirm the number of digits in base 7 for these numbers. The number 343 base 10 is 1000 base 7, which is a 4-digit number. So, the numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10 are up to 666 base 7, which is a 3-digit number. So, when considering 343 numbers, we have 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and one 4-digit number (1000 base 7). Hmm, but 1000 base 7 is 343 base 10, so maybe we should consider numbers from 000 to 666 base 7, which would be 7^3 = 343 numbers, but since we are considering positive integers, we exclude 000, so we have 342 numbers? Wait, no, the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which would be 1 to 343 inclusive. So, in base 7, that would be from 1 up to 1000 base 7. So, that includes numbers from 1 to 1000 base 7, which is 343 numbers.\n\nSo, to compute how many of these have at least one 4 or 5, we can compute total numbers (343) minus the numbers that have no 4s or 5s.\n\nSo, let's compute the number of numbers with no 4s or 5s. These numbers can only have digits 0,1,2,3,6 in each digit. But wait, in base 7, the digits are from 0 to 6, so digits allowed are 0,1,2,3,6. So, for each digit, there are 5 choices.\n\nBut we need to be careful about leading zeros. Wait, in the number 1000 base 7, which is 343, the leading digit is 1, but in numbers less than that, the leading digit can be 0? Wait, no, because we are considering positive integers, so leading zeros are not counted as separate numbers. So, for example, the number 1 in base 7 is just 1, not 001 or 0001.\n\nTherefore, when counting numbers with no 4s or 5s, we have to consider numbers with 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits in base 7, but without leading zeros.\n\nWait, but 1000 base 7 is a 4-digit number, but all other numbers up to 666 base 7 are 3 digits or less. So, perhaps it's better to model all numbers as 3-digit numbers in base 7, padding with leading zeros if necessary, but then subtract the case where all digits are zero. Hmm, but since we're dealing with positive integers, maybe it's better to handle each digit count separately.\n\nWait, another approach is to model each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, including leading zeros, which would give us exactly 343 numbers (from 000 to 666 base 7), and then subtract 1 to exclude 000, giving us 342 numbers, but the problem says 343 numbers, which includes 1000 base 7. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider all numbers from 000 to 666 base 7, which is 343 numbers, and then since we're considering positive integers, we exclude 000, so 342 numbers. But the problem says 343 smallest positive integers, which would be 1 to 343 inclusive. So, in base 7, 1 to 1000 base 7. So, including 1000 base 7, which is 343. So, the total numbers to consider are 343, which include 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and one 4-digit number.\n\nSo, to compute the number of numbers without any 4s or 5s, we can consider each digit place separately.\n\nLet me think: for 1-digit numbers, digits are 1 to 6. So, numbers without 4 or 5 are 1,2,3,6. So, 4 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers, the first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (since leading zeros are not allowed, so 4 choices), and the second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So, total 4*5=20 numbers.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers, the first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), the second and third digits can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices each). So, 4*5*5=100 numbers.\n\nAnd then, the 4-digit number, which is 1000 base 7. Its digits are 1,0,0,0. So, does it contain 4 or 5? No, it has 1 and 0s. So, it's a number without 4 or 5. So, we need to include it in our count. So, total numbers without 4 or 5 are 4 (1-digit) + 20 (2-digit) + 100 (3-digit) + 1 (4-digit) = 125.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, the 4-digit number is only one number, 1000 base 7, which is 343 in base 10. So, in our case, since we're considering numbers up to 343, which is 1000 base 7, we have to include it. So, total numbers without 4 or 5 are 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is total numbers (343) minus numbers without 4 or 5 (125). So, 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. For 1-digit numbers: 1,2,3,6: 4 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So, 4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: first digit 4 choices, second and third digits 5 choices each, so 4*5*5=100.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: only 1000 base 7, which is allowed, and it has digits 1,0,0,0, so no 4 or 5. So, 1 number.\n\nTotal without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 +1= 125.\n\nSo, total numbers: 343.\n\nNumbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When we model the numbers as 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit, we have to make sure we're not overcounting or undercounting.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider all numbers as 3-digit numbers by padding with leading zeros, but then we have to remember that 000 is not a positive integer. So, in that case, the total numbers would be from 001 to 666 base 7, which is 342 numbers, plus 1000 base 7, which is 343. So, in that case, numbers without 4 or 5 would be:\n\nFor 1-digit: 4 numbers (1,2,3,6).\n\nFor 2-digit: 4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit: 4*5*5=100.\n\nFor 4-digit: 1 number (1000).\n\nSo, total 4 + 20 + 100 +1= 125, same as before.\n\nTherefore, 343 total numbers - 125 without 4 or 5 = 218 with at least one 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but let me check if 1000 base 7 is included in the count. Yes, because we're considering up to 343, which is 1000 base 7. So, it's included, and it doesn't have any 4 or 5, so it's part of the 125 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the numbers from 1 to 343 base 10 correspond to numbers from 1 to 1000 base 7. So, we can model each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, including leading zeros, but then exclude 000. So, total numbers would be 343 (from 000 to 666), but we exclude 000, so 342 numbers. But the problem says 343 numbers, so maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, no, the problem says 343 smallest positive integers, which are 1 to 343 inclusive. So, in base 7, that's 1 to 1000 base 7. So, the total is 343 numbers.\n\nTherefore, the calculation remains 343 total - 125 without 4 or 5 = 218 with at least one 4 or 5.\n\nBut let me verify this another way. Maybe by calculating the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 directly.\n\nBut that might be more complicated, because we have to consider numbers with 4 or 5 in units, tens, or hundreds place, and then use inclusion-exclusion. Let me try that approach to cross-verify.\n\nFirst, let's consider the 343 numbers in base 7, which are from 1 to 1000 base 7.\n\nLet me define the digits as follows:\n\nFor numbers with up to 3 digits (1 to 666 base 7), we can represent them as ABC base 7, where A, B, C are digits from 0 to 6, and A can be 0 (but in that case, it's a 2 or 1-digit number). But since we're considering positive integers, A can be 0 only if B and C are non-zero? Wait, no, because 012 base 7 is 12 base 7, which is 9 base 10, which is a valid number. So, in this case, leading zeros are allowed in the digit places, but the number itself is considered as a positive integer without leading zeros.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to stick with the first method.\n\nAlternatively, let's model each number as a 3-digit number with leading zeros, so from 000 to 666 base 7, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract 1 to exclude 000, so 342 numbers, but the problem says 343 numbers, so maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which is a 4-digit number. So, in the list from 1 to 343, we have numbers from 1 to 666 base 7 (which is 342) and then 1000 base 7 (343). So, in total, 343 numbers.\n\nSo, to count numbers without 4 or 5, we have:\n\n- 1-digit: 4 numbers (1,2,3,6).\n\n- 2-digit: 4 choices for the first digit (1,2,3,6), 5 choices for the second (0,1,2,3,6). So, 4*5=20.\n\n- 3-digit: 4 choices for the first digit, 5 for the second, 5 for the third: 4*5*5=100.\n\n- 4-digit: only 1000 base 7, which doesn't have 4 or 5: 1 number.\n\nSo, total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 +1= 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nI think this makes sense. So, the answer should be 218.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's compute the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 in each digit.\n\nIn base 7, the digits are units, 7s, 49s, and 343s place.\n\nSo, for numbers from 1 to 343, which is up to 1000 base 7, we can consider each digit place:\n\n- Units place: digits 0-6.\n\n- 7s place: digits 0-6.\n\n- 49s place: digits 0-6.\n\n- 343s place: 0 or 1 (since 343 is 1000 base 7).\n\nBut since we're dealing with positive integers, the 343s place is only 1 for the number 343.\n\nSo, to compute the numbers with at least one 4 or 5, we can use inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFirst, compute the number of numbers with 4 or 5 in units place, plus those with 4 or 5 in 7s place, plus those with 4 or 5 in 49s place, and then subtract the overlaps.\n\nBut this might get complicated, but let's try.\n\nFirst, total numbers: 343.\n\nNumber with 4 or 5 in units place:\n\nIn each block of 7 numbers, there are 2 numbers with units digit 4 or 5. So, for 343 numbers, how many full blocks of 7 are there? 343 /7=49. So, 49 blocks, each contributing 2 numbers, so 49*2=98 numbers.\n\nBut wait, but numbers go up to 343, which is 1000 base 7, which is a 4-digit number. So, perhaps this approach is not straightforward because the higher digits also affect the count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the first method.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the number of numbers without 4 or 5 in any digit, which we've already done as 125, so 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 218.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 (or both), we can use complementary counting. \n\n1. **Total Numbers**: There are 343 numbers, from 1 to 343 in base 10, which correspond to numbers from 1 to 1000 in base 7.\n\n2. **Numbers Without 4 or 5**:\n   - **1-digit numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 6 \u2192 4 numbers.\n   - **2-digit numbers**: First digit (1,2,3,6) and second digit (0,1,2,3,6) \u2192 4 \u00d7 5 = 20 numbers.\n   - **3-digit numbers**: First digit (1,2,3,6), second and third digits (0,1,2,3,6) \u2192 4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 = 100 numbers.\n   - **4-digit number**: Only 1000 (base 7) \u2192 1 number.\n\n   Total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\n3. **Numbers With At Least One 4 or 5**: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{218}",
    "full_cot": "Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 or both. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. First, base 7 numbers. Base 7 digits go from 0 to 6, right? So each digit in a base 7 number can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nNow, the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7. Wait, 343 is 7 cubed, which is 7^3. So that means we're looking at all the numbers from 1 up to 343 in base 10, but converted to base 7. But actually, in base 7, the number 343 base 10 is 1000 base 7 because 7^3 is 343. So the numbers we are considering are all the base 7 numbers from 1 up to 666 base 7, because 666 base 7 is equal to 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 +6 = 294 + 42 +6= 342, and then 343 is 1000 base 7, which is beyond that. So, the numbers we are considering are all 1 to 666 base 7, which are the first 342 numbers in base 10, but the problem says 343 smallest positive integers. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 343 is 7^3, so in base 7, the numbers go up to 666 base 7, which is 342 in base 10, right? So the 343 numbers would be from 1 to 343 in base 10, but when converted to base 7, the last number is 1000 base 7. So, actually, the numbers in base 7 range from 1 (which is 1 base 7) up to 1000 base 7, which is 343 in base 10. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the problem is asking how many of these 343 numbers have at least one digit that is 4 or 5. So, in other words, among all the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, when written in base 7, how many have at least one 4 or 5 in their digits.\n\nI think the standard way to approach such problems is using complementary counting. That is, instead of counting the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5, we can count the total numbers and subtract those that have no 4s or 5s at all. So, total numbers are 343, and numbers with no 4s or 5s are those where each digit is only 0,1,2,3,6. So, let's compute that.\n\nBut wait, first, let me confirm the number of digits in base 7 for these numbers. The number 343 base 10 is 1000 base 7, which is a 4-digit number. So, the numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10 are up to 666 base 7, which is a 3-digit number. So, when considering 343 numbers, we have 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and one 4-digit number (1000 base 7). Hmm, but 1000 base 7 is 343 base 10, so maybe we should consider numbers from 000 to 666 base 7, which would be 7^3 = 343 numbers, but since we are considering positive integers, we exclude 000, so we have 342 numbers? Wait, no, the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which would be 1 to 343 inclusive. So, in base 7, that would be from 1 up to 1000 base 7. So, that includes numbers from 1 to 1000 base 7, which is 343 numbers.\n\nSo, to compute how many of these have at least one 4 or 5, we can compute total numbers (343) minus the numbers that have no 4s or 5s.\n\nSo, let's compute the number of numbers with no 4s or 5s. These numbers can only have digits 0,1,2,3,6 in each digit. But wait, in base 7, the digits are from 0 to 6, so digits allowed are 0,1,2,3,6. So, for each digit, there are 5 choices.\n\nBut we need to be careful about leading zeros. Wait, in the number 1000 base 7, which is 343, the leading digit is 1, but in numbers less than that, the leading digit can be 0? Wait, no, because we are considering positive integers, so leading zeros are not counted as separate numbers. So, for example, the number 1 in base 7 is just 1, not 001 or 0001.\n\nTherefore, when counting numbers with no 4s or 5s, we have to consider numbers with 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits in base 7, but without leading zeros.\n\nWait, but 1000 base 7 is a 4-digit number, but all other numbers up to 666 base 7 are 3 digits or less. So, perhaps it's better to model all numbers as 3-digit numbers in base 7, padding with leading zeros if necessary, but then subtract the case where all digits are zero. Hmm, but since we're dealing with positive integers, maybe it's better to handle each digit count separately.\n\nWait, another approach is to model each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, including leading zeros, which would give us exactly 343 numbers (from 000 to 666 base 7), and then subtract 1 to exclude 000, giving us 342 numbers, but the problem says 343 numbers, which includes 1000 base 7. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider all numbers from 000 to 666 base 7, which is 343 numbers, and then since we're considering positive integers, we exclude 000, so 342 numbers. But the problem says 343 smallest positive integers, which would be 1 to 343 inclusive. So, in base 7, 1 to 1000 base 7. So, including 1000 base 7, which is 343. So, the total numbers to consider are 343, which include 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and one 4-digit number.\n\nSo, to compute the number of numbers without any 4s or 5s, we can consider each digit place separately.\n\nLet me think: for 1-digit numbers, digits are 1 to 6. So, numbers without 4 or 5 are 1,2,3,6. So, 4 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers, the first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (since leading zeros are not allowed, so 4 choices), and the second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So, total 4*5=20 numbers.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers, the first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), the second and third digits can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices each). So, 4*5*5=100 numbers.\n\nAnd then, the 4-digit number, which is 1000 base 7. Its digits are 1,0,0,0. So, does it contain 4 or 5? No, it has 1 and 0s. So, it's a number without 4 or 5. So, we need to include it in our count. So, total numbers without 4 or 5 are 4 (1-digit) + 20 (2-digit) + 100 (3-digit) + 1 (4-digit) = 125.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, the 4-digit number is only one number, 1000 base 7, which is 343 in base 10. So, in our case, since we're considering numbers up to 343, which is 1000 base 7, we have to include it. So, total numbers without 4 or 5 are 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is total numbers (343) minus numbers without 4 or 5 (125). So, 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. For 1-digit numbers: 1,2,3,6: 4 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So, 4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: first digit 4 choices, second and third digits 5 choices each, so 4*5*5=100.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: only 1000 base 7, which is allowed, and it has digits 1,0,0,0, so no 4 or 5. So, 1 number.\n\nTotal without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 +1= 125.\n\nSo, total numbers: 343.\n\nNumbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When we model the numbers as 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit, we have to make sure we're not overcounting or undercounting.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider all numbers as 3-digit numbers by padding with leading zeros, but then we have to remember that 000 is not a positive integer. So, in that case, the total numbers would be from 001 to 666 base 7, which is 342 numbers, plus 1000 base 7, which is 343. So, in that case, numbers without 4 or 5 would be:\n\nFor 1-digit: 4 numbers (1,2,3,6).\n\nFor 2-digit: 4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit: 4*5*5=100.\n\nFor 4-digit: 1 number (1000).\n\nSo, total 4 + 20 + 100 +1= 125, same as before.\n\nTherefore, 343 total numbers - 125 without 4 or 5 = 218 with at least one 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but let me check if 1000 base 7 is included in the count. Yes, because we're considering up to 343, which is 1000 base 7. So, it's included, and it doesn't have any 4 or 5, so it's part of the 125 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the numbers from 1 to 343 base 10 correspond to numbers from 1 to 1000 base 7. So, we can model each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, including leading zeros, but then exclude 000. So, total numbers would be 343 (from 000 to 666), but we exclude 000, so 342 numbers. But the problem says 343 numbers, so maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, no, the problem says 343 smallest positive integers, which are 1 to 343 inclusive. So, in base 7, that's 1 to 1000 base 7. So, the total is 343 numbers.\n\nTherefore, the calculation remains 343 total - 125 without 4 or 5 = 218 with at least one 4 or 5.\n\nBut let me verify this another way. Maybe by calculating the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 directly.\n\nBut that might be more complicated, because we have to consider numbers with 4 or 5 in units, tens, or hundreds place, and then use inclusion-exclusion. Let me try that approach to cross-verify.\n\nFirst, let's consider the 343 numbers in base 7, which are from 1 to 1000 base 7.\n\nLet me define the digits as follows:\n\nFor numbers with up to 3 digits (1 to 666 base 7), we can represent them as ABC base 7, where A, B, C are digits from 0 to 6, and A can be 0 (but in that case, it's a 2 or 1-digit number). But since we're considering positive integers, A can be 0 only if B and C are non-zero? Wait, no, because 012 base 7 is 12 base 7, which is 9 base 10, which is a valid number. So, in this case, leading zeros are allowed in the digit places, but the number itself is considered as a positive integer without leading zeros.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to stick with the first method.\n\nAlternatively, let's model each number as a 3-digit number with leading zeros, so from 000 to 666 base 7, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract 1 to exclude 000, so 342 numbers, but the problem says 343 numbers, so maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which is a 4-digit number. So, in the list from 1 to 343, we have numbers from 1 to 666 base 7 (which is 342) and then 1000 base 7 (343). So, in total, 343 numbers.\n\nSo, to count numbers without 4 or 5, we have:\n\n- 1-digit: 4 numbers (1,2,3,6).\n\n- 2-digit: 4 choices for the first digit (1,2,3,6), 5 choices for the second (0,1,2,3,6). So, 4*5=20.\n\n- 3-digit: 4 choices for the first digit, 5 for the second, 5 for the third: 4*5*5=100.\n\n- 4-digit: only 1000 base 7, which doesn't have 4 or 5: 1 number.\n\nSo, total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 +1= 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nI think this makes sense. So, the answer should be 218.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's compute the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 in each digit.\n\nIn base 7, the digits are units, 7s, 49s, and 343s place.\n\nSo, for numbers from 1 to 343, which is up to 1000 base 7, we can consider each digit place:\n\n- Units place: digits 0-6.\n\n- 7s place: digits 0-6.\n\n- 49s place: digits 0-6.\n\n- 343s place: 0 or 1 (since 343 is 1000 base 7).\n\nBut since we're dealing with positive integers, the 343s place is only 1 for the number 343.\n\nSo, to compute the numbers with at least one 4 or 5, we can use inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFirst, compute the number of numbers with 4 or 5 in units place, plus those with 4 or 5 in 7s place, plus those with 4 or 5 in 49s place, and then subtract the overlaps.\n\nBut this might get complicated, but let's try.\n\nFirst, total numbers: 343.\n\nNumber with 4 or 5 in units place:\n\nIn each block of 7 numbers, there are 2 numbers with units digit 4 or 5. So, for 343 numbers, how many full blocks of 7 are there? 343 /7=49. So, 49 blocks, each contributing 2 numbers, so 49*2=98 numbers.\n\nBut wait, but numbers go up to 343, which is 1000 base 7, which is a 4-digit number. So, perhaps this approach is not straightforward because the higher digits also affect the count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the first method.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the number of numbers without 4 or 5 in any digit, which we've already done as 125, so 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 218.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 (or both), we can use complementary counting. \n\n1. **Total Numbers**: There are 343 numbers, from 1 to 343 in base 10, which correspond to numbers from 1 to 1000 in base 7.\n\n2. **Numbers Without 4 or 5**:\n   - **1-digit numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 6 \u2192 4 numbers.\n   - **2-digit numbers**: First digit (1,2,3,6) and second digit (0,1,2,3,6) \u2192 4 \u00d7 5 = 20 numbers.\n   - **3-digit numbers**: First digit (1,2,3,6), second and third digits (0,1,2,3,6) \u2192 4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 = 100 numbers.\n   - **4-digit number**: Only 1000 (base 7) \u2192 1 number.\n\n   Total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\n3. **Numbers With At Least One 4 or 5**: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{218}",
