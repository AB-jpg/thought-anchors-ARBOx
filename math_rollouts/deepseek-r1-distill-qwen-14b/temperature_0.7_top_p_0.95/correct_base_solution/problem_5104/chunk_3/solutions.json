    "rollout": " Base 7 means each digit represents a power of 7, right? So, the rightmost digit is 7^0 (which is 1), then moving left, it's 7^1 (which is 7), 7^2 (49), and so on.\n\nNow, the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7. Wait, 343 is 7^3, so that would be the numbers from 1 up to 7^3 - 1, which is 342. But the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" so maybe including 343? Wait, 343 in base 7 is 1000, right? Because 7^3 is 343, so 1000 in base 7 is 343 in decimal. So, the 343 smallest positive integers would be from 1 to 343 inclusive? Or does it mean up to 3 digits in base 7? Let me think.\n\nWait, 343 is 7^3, so in base 7, numbers from 1 to 343 would include numbers with up to four digits in base 7: from 1 (which is 1 in base 7) up to 1000 (which is 343 in decimal). But I'm a bit confused because the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" which would be 1 to 343. So, I need to consider all numbers from 1 to 343, inclusive, and count how many of their base 7 representations include at least one 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the total numbers without any 4 or 5 and subtract that from the total. So, total numbers are 343. If I can find how many numbers in base 7 from 1 to 343 don't have any 4 or 5, then subtract that from 343 to get the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nYes, that sounds like a plan. So, total numbers = 343. Numbers without any 4 or 5 = ?\n\nIn base 7, each digit can be 0 to 6. But since we're dealing with positive integers, leading zeros are not allowed. So, for numbers from 1 to 343, how many have digits only from {0,1,2,3,6} in each digit except the leading digit, which can be 1,2,3,6 as well.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Each digit in base 7 can be 0 to 6. But when we're considering numbers without 4 or 5, each digit can be 0,1,2,3, or 6. So, for each digit, there are 5 choices instead of 7.\n\nBut wait, the leading digit can't be zero, so for numbers with 1 digit, the leading digit has 5 choices (1,2,3,6) but wait, no, in base 7, the digits are 0-6, but leading zeros are not allowed, so for 1-digit numbers, digits can be 1,2,3,6, which is 4 choices. Wait, but 0 is not a positive integer, so 1-digit numbers without 4 or 5 would be 4 numbers: 1,2,3,6.\n\nWait, but in base 7, the digits allowed for each position when excluding 4 and 5 are 0,1,2,3,6. But for the first digit (the leading digit), it can't be zero, so it has 4 choices: 1,2,3,6. For the other digits, they can be 0,1,2,3,6, so 5 choices each.\n\nSo, to calculate the total numbers without any 4 or 5, we need to consider numbers with 1 digit, 2 digits, 3 digits, and 4 digits (since 343 is 1000 in base 7, which is a 4-digit number).\n\nWait, but 343 is 1000 in base 7, which is 4 digits. So, numbers from 1 to 342 are up to 3 digits in base 7, and 343 is a 4-digit number.\n\nSo, let me break it down:\n\n1-digit numbers: 1 to 6 in base 7, which are 1 to 6 in decimal.\n\n2-digit numbers: 10 to 66 in base 7, which are 7 to 48 in decimal.\n\n3-digit numbers: 100 to 666 in base 7, which are 49 to 342 in decimal.\n\n4-digit number: 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in decimal.\n\nBut since we're considering numbers up to 343, which is 1000 in base 7, we need to include this number as well.\n\nSo, to calculate the total numbers without any 4 or 5, we can calculate for 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers separately.\n\n1-digit numbers without 4 or 5:\n\nAs I thought earlier, digits can be 1,2,3,6, so 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers without 4 or 5:\n\nThe first digit (tens place in base 7) can be 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), and the second digit (units place) can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So, total 4*5 = 20 numbers.\n\n3-digit numbers without 4 or 5:\n\nFirst digit (hundreds place): 1,2,3,6 (4 choices).\n\nSecond digit (tens place): 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices).\n\nThird digit (units place): 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices).\n\nSo, total 4*5*5 = 100 numbers.\n\n4-digit numbers without 4 or 5:\n\nOnly the number 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in decimal. Now, does 1000 in base 7 have any 4 or 5? Let's see: 1,0,0,0. No, it doesn't. So, it doesn't have 4 or 5, so we need to include it.\n\nBut wait, 1000 in base 7 is 343 in decimal. So, is 343 included in our count? Yes, because the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which would be 1 to 343 inclusive.\n\nSo, 4-digit numbers without 4 or 5: only 1000, which is 1 number.\n\nSo, total numbers without any 4 or 5:\n\n1-digit: 4\n\n2-digit: 20\n\n3-digit: 100\n\n4-digit:1\n\nTotal: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nWait, for 1-digit numbers, we have 4 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers, first digit 4 choices, second digit 5 choices, so 20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers, 4*5*5=100.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers, only 1000, which is 1 number.\n\nSo total is 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nTherefore, total numbers without any 4 or 5: 125.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this is correct. Because when we're considering numbers up to 343, which is 1000 in base 7, the 4-digit number is only 1000, so only one number.\n\nTherefore, numbers without 4 or 5: 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: total numbers (343) minus numbers without any 4 or 5 (125) = 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify this because I might have made a mistake in the count.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that in base 7, each digit can be 0-6, but we're excluding 4 and 5, so each digit has 5 choices if we include 0, but for the leading digit, it's 4 choices (1,2,3,6).\n\nBut wait, let me consider the number of digits. For numbers up to 343, which is 1000 in base 7, the maximum number of digits is 4.\n\nSo, for numbers with 1 digit: 4 numbers (1,2,3,6)\n\nFor numbers with 2 digits: first digit 4 choices, second digit 5 choices: 4*5=20\n\nFor numbers with 3 digits: 4*5*5=100\n\nFor numbers with 4 digits: only 1000, which is 1 number.\n\nSo, total numbers without 4 or 5: 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nThus, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that 343 is included in the count. Since the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which are 1 to 343 inclusive, so yes, 343 is included.\n\nBut wait, 343 in base 7 is 1000, which doesn't have any 4 or 5, so it's included in the 125 numbers without 4 or 5. So, 343 - 125 = 218 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is 343 included in the count? Because 343 is 1000 in base 7, which is a 4-digit number, so yes, it's part of the 343 numbers. So, the total is 343, and numbers without 4 or 5 are 125, so 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about it another way. Maybe using permutations.\n\nIn base 7, each digit can be considered as a position, and for each position, we have certain choices.\n\nBut perhaps I can think in terms of digits. Let's see.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit in the number, calculate the number of possibilities where at least one digit is 4 or 5.\n\nBut that might be more complicated because it involves inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, but let me try. The total number of numbers from 1 to 343 is 343.\n\nThe number of numbers where at least one digit is 4 or 5 is equal to total numbers minus numbers where no digit is 4 or 5.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier, getting 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut let me verify the count of numbers without 4 or 5 again, because that's crucial.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5 in base 7:\n\n1-digit: 1,2,3,6 => 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit: first digit (1,2,3,6) and second digit (0,1,2,3,6). So, 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit: first digit 4 choices, second and third digits 5 choices each: 4*5*5=100.\n\n4-digit: only 1000, which is 343 in decimal. So, 1 number.\n\nTotal: 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 directly.\n\nBut that might involve more steps because I have to consider each digit position and whether it contains 4 or 5, which could involve inclusion-exclusion.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, calculate how many numbers have a 4 or 5 in that position, then adjust for overlaps.\n\nBut that might be more complicated, but let's try.\n\nIn base 7, numbers up to 343 (1000 in base 7) can have 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits.\n\nLet's consider each digit position:\n\n1-digit numbers: 1 to 6.\n\nNumber of 1-digit numbers with 4 or 5: 2 numbers (4 and 5).\n\n2-digit numbers: from 10 to 66 in base 7.\n\nEach 2-digit number has two digits: tens and units.\n\nNumber of 2-digit numbers with at least one 4 or 5: total 2-digit numbers without restriction minus numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nTotal 2-digit numbers: from 10 to 66 in base 7, which is 6*7 = 42 numbers in decimal? Wait, no.\n\nWait, in base 7, 2-digit numbers go from 10 (which is 7 in decimal) to 66 (which is 6*7 + 6 = 48 in decimal). So, total 48 - 7 + 1 = 42 numbers.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5 in 2-digit numbers: as calculated earlier, 4*5=20.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 20, but now I'm thinking that 2-digit numbers without 4 or 5 are 4*5=20, so numbers with at least one 4 or 5 would be 42 - 20 = 22.\n\nSimilarly, for 3-digit numbers:\n\nTotal 3-digit numbers in base 7: from 100 (49 in decimal) to 666 (342 in decimal). So, 342 - 49 + 1 = 342 - 49 = 293 +1=294 numbers.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5 in 3-digit numbers: 4*5*5=100.\n\nSo, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 294 - 100 = 194.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: only 1000, which is 343 in decimal. Does it have 4 or 5? No, so numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 0.\n\nSo, total numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 2 (from 1-digit) +22 (from 2-digit) +194 (from 3-digit) +0 (from 4-digit) = 2+22=24, 24+194=218.\n\nSo, same result as before: 218.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I calculated numbers without 4 or 5 as 125, and total numbers as 343, so 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut let me check: 343 - 125 is indeed 218.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many numbers have 4 or 5 in each digit.\n\nBut that might be more involved. But let's try.\n\nFor 1-digit numbers: 4 and 5 are the only ones, so 2 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers:\n\nNumber of 2-digit numbers with 4 or 5 in the tens place: tens digit can be 4 or 5, so 2 choices, and units digit can be 0-6, so 7 choices. But wait, but in our case, we're excluding numbers beyond 343, but since we're dealing with 2-digit numbers, they go up to 66 in base 7, which is 48 in decimal, so all 2-digit numbers are within 343. So, number of 2-digit numbers with 4 or 5 in tens place: 2*7=14.\n\nNumber of 2-digit numbers with 4 or 5 in units place: tens digit can be 1-6, but excluding those where tens digit is 4 or 5? Wait, no, we need to count numbers where units digit is 4 or 5, regardless of tens digit.\n\nSo, units digit can be 4 or 5: 2 choices, and tens digit can be 1-6: 6 choices. So, 6*2=12.\n\nBut wait, this counts numbers where tens digit is 4 or 5 and units digit is 4 or 5 twice. So, to apply inclusion-exclusion, total numbers with 4 or 5 in tens or units place: 14 +12 - (numbers where both tens and units digits are 4 or 5).\n\nNumbers where both digits are 4 or 5: tens digit 2 choices, units digit 2 choices, so 4 numbers.\n\nTherefore, total 2-digit numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 14 +12 -4 = 22, which matches our earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for 3-digit numbers:\n\nNumber of 3-digit numbers with 4 or 5 in hundreds place: hundreds digit 2 choices (4 or 5), tens digit 7 choices, units digit 7 choices: 2*7*7=98.\n\nNumber with 4 or 5 in tens place: hundreds digit can be 1-6 (excluding 4 and 5, but wait, no: we're counting numbers where tens digit is 4 or 5, regardless of hundreds digit. So, hundreds digit can be 1-6 (6 choices), tens digit 2 choices (4 or 5), units digit 7 choices: 6*2*7=84.\n\nNumber with 4 or 5 in units place: hundreds digit 6 choices, tens digit 7 choices, units digit 2 choices: 6*7*2=84.\n\nNow, subtract overlaps:\n\nNumbers where hundreds and tens digits are 4 or 5: 2*2*7=28.\n\nNumbers where hundreds and units digits are 4 or 5: 2*7*2=28.\n\nNumbers where tens and units digits are 4 or 5: 6*2*2=24.\n\nNow, add back numbers where all three digits are 4 or 5: 2*2*2=8.\n\nSo, applying inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal = 98 +84 +84 -28 -28 -24 +8.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\n98 +84=182; 182 +84=266.\n\n266 -28=238; 238 -28=210; 210 -24=186.\n\n186 +8=194.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count of 194 3-digit numbers with at least one 4 or 5.\n\nTherefore, adding up:\n\n1-digit:2\n\n2-digit:22\n\n3-digit:194\n\n4-digit:0\n\nTotal:2+22=24; 24+194=218.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 218.\n\nWait, but let me just check one more thing: when we calculated numbers without 4 or 5 as 125, which included 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers. Let's make sure that 125 is correct.\n\n1-digit:4\n\n2-digit:20\n\n3-digit:100\n\n4-digit:1\n\nTotal:125.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, 343 -125=218.\n\nI think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, include the",
    "full_cot": "Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 or both. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. First, base 7 numbers. Base 7 means each digit represents a power of 7, right? So, the rightmost digit is 7^0 (which is 1), then moving left, it's 7^1 (which is 7), 7^2 (49), and so on.\n\nNow, the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7. Wait, 343 is 7^3, so that would be the numbers from 1 up to 7^3 - 1, which is 342. But the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" so maybe including 343? Wait, 343 in base 7 is 1000, right? Because 7^3 is 343, so 1000 in base 7 is 343 in decimal. So, the 343 smallest positive integers would be from 1 to 343 inclusive? Or does it mean up to 3 digits in base 7? Let me think.\n\nWait, 343 is 7^3, so in base 7, numbers from 1 to 343 would include numbers with up to four digits in base 7: from 1 (which is 1 in base 7) up to 1000 (which is 343 in decimal). But I'm a bit confused because the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" which would be 1 to 343. So, I need to consider all numbers from 1 to 343, inclusive, and count how many of their base 7 representations include at least one 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the total numbers without any 4 or 5 and subtract that from the total. So, total numbers are 343. If I can find how many numbers in base 7 from 1 to 343 don't have any 4 or 5, then subtract that from 343 to get the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nYes, that sounds like a plan. So, total numbers = 343. Numbers without any 4 or 5 = ?\n\nIn base 7, each digit can be 0 to 6. But since we're dealing with positive integers, leading zeros are not allowed. So, for numbers from 1 to 343, how many have digits only from {0,1,2,3,6} in each digit except the leading digit, which can be 1,2,3,6 as well.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Each digit in base 7 can be 0 to 6. But when we're considering numbers without 4 or 5, each digit can be 0,1,2,3, or 6. So, for each digit, there are 5 choices instead of 7.\n\nBut wait, the leading digit can't be zero, so for numbers with 1 digit, the leading digit has 5 choices (1,2,3,6) but wait, no, in base 7, the digits are 0-6, but leading zeros are not allowed, so for 1-digit numbers, digits can be 1,2,3,6, which is 4 choices. Wait, but 0 is not a positive integer, so 1-digit numbers without 4 or 5 would be 4 numbers: 1,2,3,6.\n\nWait, but in base 7, the digits allowed for each position when excluding 4 and 5 are 0,1,2,3,6. But for the first digit (the leading digit), it can't be zero, so it has 4 choices: 1,2,3,6. For the other digits, they can be 0,1,2,3,6, so 5 choices each.\n\nSo, to calculate the total numbers without any 4 or 5, we need to consider numbers with 1 digit, 2 digits, 3 digits, and 4 digits (since 343 is 1000 in base 7, which is a 4-digit number).\n\nWait, but 343 is 1000 in base 7, which is 4 digits. So, numbers from 1 to 342 are up to 3 digits in base 7, and 343 is a 4-digit number.\n\nSo, let me break it down:\n\n1-digit numbers: 1 to 6 in base 7, which are 1 to 6 in decimal.\n\n2-digit numbers: 10 to 66 in base 7, which are 7 to 48 in decimal.\n\n3-digit numbers: 100 to 666 in base 7, which are 49 to 342 in decimal.\n\n4-digit number: 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in decimal.\n\nBut since we're considering numbers up to 343, which is 1000 in base 7, we need to include this number as well.\n\nSo, to calculate the total numbers without any 4 or 5, we can calculate for 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers separately.\n\n1-digit numbers without 4 or 5:\n\nAs I thought earlier, digits can be 1,2,3,6, so 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers without 4 or 5:\n\nThe first digit (tens place in base 7) can be 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), and the second digit (units place) can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So, total 4*5 = 20 numbers.\n\n3-digit numbers without 4 or 5:\n\nFirst digit (hundreds place): 1,2,3,6 (4 choices).\n\nSecond digit (tens place): 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices).\n\nThird digit (units place): 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices).\n\nSo, total 4*5*5 = 100 numbers.\n\n4-digit numbers without 4 or 5:\n\nOnly the number 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in decimal. Now, does 1000 in base 7 have any 4 or 5? Let's see: 1,0,0,0. No, it doesn't. So, it doesn't have 4 or 5, so we need to include it.\n\nBut wait, 1000 in base 7 is 343 in decimal. So, is 343 included in our count? Yes, because the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which would be 1 to 343 inclusive.\n\nSo, 4-digit numbers without 4 or 5: only 1000, which is 1 number.\n\nSo, total numbers without any 4 or 5:\n\n1-digit: 4\n\n2-digit: 20\n\n3-digit: 100\n\n4-digit:1\n\nTotal: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nWait, for 1-digit numbers, we have 4 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers, first digit 4 choices, second digit 5 choices, so 20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers, 4*5*5=100.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers, only 1000, which is 1 number.\n\nSo total is 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nTherefore, total numbers without any 4 or 5: 125.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this is correct. Because when we're considering numbers up to 343, which is 1000 in base 7, the 4-digit number is only 1000, so only one number.\n\nTherefore, numbers without 4 or 5: 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: total numbers (343) minus numbers without any 4 or 5 (125) = 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify this because I might have made a mistake in the count.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that in base 7, each digit can be 0-6, but we're excluding 4 and 5, so each digit has 5 choices if we include 0, but for the leading digit, it's 4 choices (1,2,3,6).\n\nBut wait, let me consider the number of digits. For numbers up to 343, which is 1000 in base 7, the maximum number of digits is 4.\n\nSo, for numbers with 1 digit: 4 numbers (1,2,3,6)\n\nFor numbers with 2 digits: first digit 4 choices, second digit 5 choices: 4*5=20\n\nFor numbers with 3 digits: 4*5*5=100\n\nFor numbers with 4 digits: only 1000, which is 1 number.\n\nSo, total numbers without 4 or 5: 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nThus, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that 343 is included in the count. Since the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which are 1 to 343 inclusive, so yes, 343 is included.\n\nBut wait, 343 in base 7 is 1000, which doesn't have any 4 or 5, so it's included in the 125 numbers without 4 or 5. So, 343 - 125 = 218 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is 343 included in the count? Because 343 is 1000 in base 7, which is a 4-digit number, so yes, it's part of the 343 numbers.

The total number of numbers from 1 to 343 is 343.\n\nThe number of numbers where at least one digit is 4 or 5 is equal to total numbers minus numbers where no digit is 4 or 5.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier, getting 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut let me verify the count of numbers without 4 or 5 again, because that's crucial.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5 in base 7:\n\n1-digit: 1,2,3,6 => 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit: first digit (1,2,3,6) and second digit (0,1,2,3,6). So, 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit: first digit 4 choices, second and third digits 5 choices each: 4*5*5=100.\n\n4-digit: only 1000, which is 343 in decimal. So, 1 number.\n\nTotal: 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 directly.\n\nBut that might involve more steps because I have to consider each digit position and whether it contains 4 or 5, which could involve inclusion-exclusion.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, calculate how many numbers have a 4 or 5 in that position, then adjust for overlaps.\n\nBut that might be more complicated, but let's try.\n\nIn base 7, numbers up to 343 (1000 in base 7) can have 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits.\n\nLet's consider each digit position:\n\n1-digit numbers: 1 to 6.\n\nNumber of 1-digit numbers with 4 or 5: 2 numbers (4 and 5).\n\n2-digit numbers: from 10 to 66 in base 7.\n\nEach 2-digit number has two digits: tens and units.\n\nNumber of 2-digit numbers with at least one 4 or 5: total 2-digit numbers without restriction minus numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nTotal 2-digit numbers: from 10 to 66 in base 7, which is 6*7 = 42 numbers in decimal? Wait, no.\n\nWait, in base 7, 2-digit numbers go from 10 (which is 7 in decimal) to 66 (which is 6*7 + 6 = 48 in decimal). So, total 48 - 7 + 1 = 42 numbers.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5 in 2-digit numbers: as calculated earlier, 4*5=20.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 20, but now I'm thinking that 2-digit numbers without 4 or 5 are 4*5=20, so numbers with at least one 4 or 5 would be 42 - 20 = 22.\n\nSimilarly, for 3-digit numbers:\n\nTotal 3-digit numbers in base 7: from 100 (49 in decimal) to 666 (342 in decimal). So, 342 - 49 + 1 = 342 - 49 = 293 +1=294 numbers.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5 in 3-digit numbers: 4*5*5=100.\n\nSo, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 294 - 100 = 194.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: only 1000, which is 343 in decimal. Does it have 4 or 5? No, so numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 0.\n\nSo, total numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 2 (from 1-digit) +22 (from 2-digit) +194 (from 3-digit) +0 (from 4-digit) = 2+22=24, 24+194=218.\n\nSo, same result as before: 218.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I calculated numbers without 4 or 5 as 125, and total numbers as 343, so 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut let me check: 343 - 125 is indeed 218.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many numbers have 4 or 5 in each digit.\n\nBut that might be more involved. But let's try.\n\nFor 1-digit numbers: 4 and 5 are the only ones, so 2 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers:\n\nNumber of 2-digit numbers with 4 or 5 in the tens place: tens digit can be 4 or 5, so 2 choices, and units digit can be 0-6, so 7 choices. But wait, but in our case, we're excluding numbers beyond 343, but since we're dealing with 2-digit numbers, they go up to 66 in base 7, which is 48 in decimal, so all 2-digit numbers are within 343. So, number of 2-digit numbers with 4 or 5 in tens place: 2*7=14.\n\nNumber of 2-digit numbers with 4 or 5 in units place: tens digit can be 1-6, but excluding those where tens digit is 4 or 5? Wait, no, we need to count numbers where units digit is 4 or 5, regardless of tens digit.\n\nSo, units digit can be 4 or 5: 2 choices, and tens digit can be 1-6: 6 choices. So, 6*2=12.\n\nBut wait, this counts numbers where tens digit is 4 or 5 and units digit is 4 or 5 twice. So, to apply inclusion-exclusion, total numbers with 4 or 5 in tens or units place: 14 +12 - (numbers where both tens and units digits are 4 or 5).\n\nNumbers where both digits are 4 or 5: tens digit 2 choices, units digit 2 choices, so 4 numbers.\n\nTherefore, total 2-digit numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 14 +12 -4 = 22, which matches our earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for 3-digit numbers:\n\nNumber of 3-digit numbers with 4 or 5 in hundreds place: hundreds digit 2 choices (4 or 5), tens digit 7 choices, units digit 7 choices: 2*7*7=98.\n\nNumber with 4 or 5 in tens place: hundreds digit can be 1-6 (excluding 4 and 5, but wait, no: we're counting numbers where tens digit is 4 or 5, regardless of hundreds digit. So, hundreds digit can be 1-6 (6 choices), tens digit 2 choices (4 or 5), units digit 7 choices: 6*2*7=84.\n\nNumber with 4 or 5 in units place: hundreds digit 6 choices, tens digit 7 choices, units digit 2 choices: 6*7*2=84.\n\nNow, subtract overlaps:\n\nNumbers where hundreds and tens digits are 4 or 5: 2*2*7=28.\n\nNumbers where hundreds and units digits are 4 or 5: 2*7*2=28.\n\nNumbers where tens and units digits are 4 or 5: 6*2*2=24.\n\nNow, add back numbers where all three digits are 4 or 5: 2*2*2=8.\n\nSo, applying inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal = 98 +84 +84 -28 -28 -24 +8.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\n98 +84=182; 182 +84=266.\n\n266 -28=238; 238 -28=210; 210 -24=186.\n\n186 +8=194.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count of 194 3-digit numbers with at least one 4 or 5.\n\nTherefore, adding up:\n\n1-digit:2\n\n2-digit:22\n\n3-digit:194\n\n4-digit:0\n\nTotal:2+22=24; 24+194=218.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 218.\n\nWait, but let me just check one more thing: when we calculated numbers without 4 or 5 as 125, which included 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers. Let's make sure that 125 is correct.\n\n1-digit:4\n\n2-digit:20\n\n3-digit:100\n\n4-digit:1\n\nTotal:125.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, 343 -125=218.\n\nI think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, include the",

Wait, 343 is 7^3, so that means we're dealing with numbers from 1 up to 7^3, which is 343 in base 10. So, in base 7, these numbers will range from 1 (which is 1 in base 7) up to 666 in base 7, because 666 base 7 is equal to 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342 in base 10, but wait, 343 is 1000 in base 7, so maybe the numbers go up to 666 base 7, which is 342, and then 343 is 1000 base 7, which is outside the 343 smallest positive integers. So, actually, the numbers are from 1 to 342 in base 10, which is 1 to 666 in base 7.\n\nWait, no, hold on. The problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so that would be from 1 to 343 in base 10. But 343 in base 7 is 1000, right? Because 7^3 is 343. So, 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7. So, the numbers we're considering are from 1 to 343 in base 10, which is 1 to 1000 in base 7. So, in base 7, these numbers can have up to four digits: 0001 up to 1000, but we're only considering positive integers, so starting from 1.\n\nWait, but 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, so that's included in the 343 numbers. So, the numbers in base 7 will be 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers, with the 4-digit number being 1000 only.\n\nNow, the problem is to find how many of these numbers have at least one digit that is 4 or 5, or both. So, I think the best approach here is to use complementary counting. That is, instead of counting all the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5, I can subtract the number of numbers that have no 4s and no 5s from the total number of numbers. That should give me the count I need.\n\nSo, the total number of positive integers we're considering is 343, right? From 1 to 343 inclusive. Now, how many numbers in this range, when written in base 7, have no 4s and no 5s in any digit? Let's denote this number as N. Then, the answer we're looking for is 343 - N.\n\nSo, first, let me figure out how many base 7 numbers from 1 to 666 (which is 342 in base 10) have no 4s and no 5s. Wait, but 343 is 1000 in base 7, which is a 4-digit number. So, I need to consider all numbers from 1 to 1000 in base 7, which includes 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers.\n\nBut since 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, and we're including that, I need to make sure to count it properly. However, 1000 in base 7 has digits 1, 0, 0, 0, so it doesn't contain 4 or 5. So, it would be included in the count of numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but in the problem, are we including 343? Let me check: the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" which would be 1 through 343 inclusive. So, 343 is included, and in base 7, it's 1000. So, we need to include that in our count.\n\nNow, let me think about how to calculate N, the number of base 7 numbers from 1 to 1000 (base 7) that don't have any 4s or 5s in any digit.\n\nEach digit in a base 7 number can be 0 to 6. But since we're dealing with positive integers, the first digit (the highest place value) can't be zero. So, for 1-digit numbers, the digit is from 1 to 6. For 2-digit numbers, the first digit is from 1 to 6, and the second digit is from 0 to 6. Similarly for 3-digit and 4-digit numbers.\n\nBut since we're excluding 4 and 5, each digit can only be 0,1,2,3,6. However, the first digit can't be zero, so for each digit position, we have different possibilities.\n\nLet me break this down by the number of digits:\n\n1-digit numbers: 1 to 6 in base 7, which is 1 to 6 in base 10. We need to count how many of these don't have 4 or 5. So, the digits allowed are 1,2,3,6. That's 4 options. So, N1 = 4.\n\n2-digit numbers: In base 7, a 2-digit number ranges from 10 (which is 7 in base 10) to 66 (which is 6*7 + 6 = 48 in base 10). Each 2-digit number has two digits: the first digit (from 1 to 6) and the second digit (from 0 to 6). But we're excluding 4 and 5, so each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. However, the first digit can't be zero, so it has 4 options (1,2,3,6), and the second digit has 5 options (0,1,2,3,6). So, N2 = 4 * 5 = 20.\n\n3-digit numbers: Similarly, a 3-digit number in base 7 ranges from 100 (which is 49 in base 10) to 666 (which is 342 in base 10). Each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6, but the first digit can't be zero. So, the first digit has 4 options, the second and third digits have 5 options each. So, N3 = 4 * 5 * 5 = 100.\n\n4-digit numbers: The only 4-digit number in our range is 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in base 10. As I noted earlier, 1000 in base 7 has digits 1,0,0,0, which don't include 4 or 5. So, N4 = 1.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. In base 7, 4-digit numbers go from 1000 to 6666, but in our case, we're only going up to 1000, which is 343 in base 10. So, the only 4-digit number is 1000, which doesn't have any 4s or 5s. So, N4 = 1.\n\nNow, adding them up: N = N1 + N2 + N3 + N4 = 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me verify this. So, N is the number of numbers from 1 to 343 (base 10) that, when written in base 7, have no 4s or 5s in any digit. So, N = 125.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 is total numbers (343) minus N (125), which is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 125 seems a bit low. Let me go through each digit count again.\n\n1-digit numbers: 1-6. Excluding 4 and 5, so allowed digits are 1,2,3,6. That's 4 numbers. So, N1=4. That seems correct.\n\n2-digit numbers: First digit (tens place in base 7) can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit (units place) can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So, 4*5=20. That seems correct.\n\n3-digit numbers: First digit: 4 options, second and third digits: 5 options each. So, 4*5*5=100. Correct.\n\n4-digit number: Only 1000, which is allowed, so 1. Correct.\n\nSo, total N = 4 + 20 + 100 +1 = 125.\n\nThus, the answer is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When we're dealing with numbers up to 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in base 10, we're considering all numbers from 1 to 343. So, in base 7, numbers with 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits.\n\nWait, but another way to calculate N is to consider each digit's possibilities without 4 or 5. So, for each digit position, except the first, the number of options is 5 (0,1,2,3,6), and for the first digit, it's 4 (1,2,3,6).\n\nBut since the numbers can have up to 4 digits, let's model it as all 4-digit numbers with leading zeros allowed, but then subtract the case where all digits are zero.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, we can model it as numbers with up to 3 digits, since 1000 is a separate case.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the number of numbers without any 4 or 5 in base 7 up to 3 digits (i.e., up to 666 in base 7, which is 342 in base 10) plus the number 1000 in base 7.\n\nSo, for 1-digit numbers: 4 options.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: 4*5 = 20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: 4*5*5=100.\n\nThen, 4-digit number: 1.\n\nTotal N = 4 + 20 + 100 +1 = 125.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the total numbers is 343, so the answer is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm including 0 in the count. Wait, the problem says positive integers, so 0 isn't included. So, when I calculate N, I have to make sure I'm only counting positive integers.\n\nIn my calculation, N is the count of positive integers from 1 to 343 that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is to model each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, allowing leading zeros, which would cover all numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7, which is 0 to 342 in base 10. Then, adding 1 for 1000 in base 7 (343 in base 10).\n\nBut in that case, the total numbers would be 343 (from 000 to 666) plus 1 (1000), but since we're only considering positive integers, we exclude 000, so 343 numbers from 001 to 666, which is 1 to 342, plus 1000, which is 343. So, total 343 numbers.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to model it as 4-digit numbers with leading zeros allowed, but then subtract the cases where numbers are longer than needed. Hmm, maybe not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for numbers without certain digits in each position.\n\nSo, for each digit, the number of options without 4 or 5 is:\n\n- For the first digit (if it's a 3-digit number or less), 4 options (1,2,3,6).\n\n- For other digits, 5 options (0,1,2,3,6).\n\nSo, the total number of such numbers with up to 3 digits is:\n\n- 1-digit: 4\n\n- 2-digit: 4*5=20\n\n- 3-digit: 4*5*5=100\n\nPlus the 4-digit number 1000, which is 1.\n\nTotal N=4+20+100+1=125.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 343 total numbers minus 125 without 4 or 5 gives 218 numbers that have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but let me check with a small example to see if this approach works.\n\nSuppose I take a smaller case, say base 2, and count how many numbers from 1 to 8 (which is 2^3) have at least one 1 in their binary representation. Well, in binary, numbers from 1 to 8 are 1 to 1000. The numbers without any 1s would only be 0, but since we're considering positive integers, the count would be 0. So, the answer would be 8 - 0 = 8, which is correct because every number from 1 to 8 in binary has at least one '1'.\n\nWait, that seems to check out.\n\nAnother example: base 3, numbers from 1 to 27 (3^3). How many have at least one digit 1 or 2? Wait, but in base 3, digits are 0,1,2. So, all numbers except 0 would have at least one digit that is 1 or 2. But since we're excluding 0, all numbers from 1 to 27 would have at least one digit that is 1 or 2, so the answer would be 27. But let's test the complementary counting.\n\nNumbers without any 1 or 2 in base 3: only 0, which isn't included, so N=0, so 27 - 0 =27, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let's try a case where we exclude some digits. For example, in base 3, how many numbers from 1 to 9 (which is 3^2) have no 1s or 2s? Well, only 0, but since we're considering positive integers, none. So, the answer would be 9 - 0=9 numbers that have at least one 1 or 2, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps a better example: base 4, numbers from 1 to 64 (4^3). How many have at least one 2 or 3.\n\nUsing complementary counting: numbers without 2 or 3 would have digits only 0 and 1. But since we're dealing with positive integers, the first digit can't be 0.\n\nSo, for 1-digit numbers: digits allowed are 1. So, N1=1.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit can be 1, second digit can be 0 or 1. So, 1*2=2.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit=1, second and third digits=0 or 1. So, 1*2*2=4.\n\n4-digit number: only 1000 in base 4, which is 64 in base 10, but in our range, we're considering up to 64, which is 1000 in base 4. So, N4=1.\n\nWait, but in base 4, 1000 is 64, which is included. So, total N=1+2+4+1=8.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers with at least one 2 or 3 would be 64 - 8=56.\n\nWait, but let me check by another method. For each digit, the number of options without 2 or 3 is:\n\n1-digit: 1 option (1).\n\n2-digit: 1 (first digit) * 2 (second digit) = 2.\n\n3-digit: 1*2*2=4.\n\n4-digit: 1.\n\nTotal N=8. So, 64 -8=56. That seems correct.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to our original problem, N=125, so the answer is 343 - 125=218.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 4-digit number in base 7. 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10. So, in our count of N, we included it because it doesn't have any 4s or 5s. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the problem as counting the numbers without 4 or 5 in any digit, which would be for each digit:\n\n- For the first digit (if it's a 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, or 4-digit number), the options are 1,2,3,6.\n\n- For other digits, options are 0,1,2,3,6.\n\nSo, the number of such numbers is:\n\nFor 1-digit: 4.\n\nFor 2-digit: 4*5.\n\nFor 3-digit: 4*5*5.\n\nFor 4-digit: 4*5*5*5, but wait, no. Because 1000 is the only 4-digit number, and in that case, the first digit is 1, and the rest are 0s. So, in that case, it's only 1 number, not 4*5*5*5.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused something here. Let me clarify.\n\nIn base 7, numbers with up to 3 digits can be represented as 3-digit numbers with leading zeros, which allows us to model each number as a 3-digit number where each digit can be 0-6, except the first digit can't be zero for positive integers.\n\nBut when we include 4-digit numbers, it's only 1000, which is 343 in base 10.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model all numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7 (which is 0 to 342 in base 10) plus 1000 (343). So, total 343 numbers.\n\nIn that case, the number of numbers without 4 or 5 in any digit would be:\n\n- For 000: not included as it's zero.\n\n- For numbers from 001 to 666: each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6, but first digit can't be zero.\n\nSo, for 1-digit: 1 to 6, allowed digits: 1,2,3,6 \u2192 4 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options) \u2192 4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit: first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 options each \u2192 4*5*5=100.\n\nPlus, the number 1000,",

Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 or both. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. First, base 7 numbers. So, in base 7, each digit represents a power of 7, right? The digits go from 0 to 6, just like in base 10 they go from 0 to 9.\n\nNow, the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7. Wait, 343 is 7^3, so that means we're dealing with numbers from 1 up to 7^3, which is 343 in base 10. So, in base 7, these numbers will range from 1 (which is 1 in base 7) up to 666 in base 7, because 666 base 7 is equal to 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342 in base 10, but wait, 343 is 1000 in base 7, so maybe the numbers go up to 666 base 7, which is 342, and then 343 is 1000 base 7, which is outside the 343 smallest positive integers. So, actually, the numbers are from 1 to 342 in base 10, which is 1 to 666 in base 7.\n\nWait, no, hold on. The problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so that would be from 1 to 343 in base 10. But 343 in base 7 is 1000, right? Because 7^3 is 343. So, 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7. So, the numbers we're considering are from 1 to 343 in base 10, which is 1 to 1000 in base 7. So, in base 7, these numbers can have up to four digits: 0001 up to 1000, but we're only considering positive integers, so starting from 1.\n\nWait, but 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, so that's included in the 343 numbers. So, the numbers in base 7 will be 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers, with the 4-digit number being 1000 only.\n\nNow, the problem is to find how many of these numbers have at least one digit that is 4 or 5, or both. So, I think the best approach here is to use complementary counting. That is, instead of counting all the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5, I can subtract the number of numbers that have no 4s and no 5s from the total number of numbers. That should give me the count I need.\n\nSo, the total number of positive integers we're considering is 343, right? From 1 to 343 inclusive. Now, how many numbers in this range, when written in base 7, have no 4s and no 5s in any digit? Let's denote this number as N. Then, the answer we're looking for is 343 - N.\n\nSo, first, let me figure out how many base 7 numbers from 1 to 666 (which is 342 in base 10) have no 4s and no 5s. Wait, but 343 is 1000 in base 7, which is a 4-digit number. So, I need to consider all numbers from 1 to 1000 in base 7, which includes 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers.\n\nBut since 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, and we're including that, I need to make sure to count it properly. However, 1000 in base 7 has digits 1, 0, 0, 0, so it doesn't contain 4 or 5. So, it would be included in the count of numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but in the problem, are we including 343? Let me check: the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" which would be 1 through 343 inclusive. So, 343 is included, and in base 7, it's 1000. So, we need to include that in our count.\n\nNow, let me think about how to calculate N, the number of base 7 numbers from 1 to 1000 (base 7) that don't have any 4s or 5s in any digit.\n\nEach digit in a base 7 number can be 0 to 6. But since we're dealing with positive integers, the first digit (the highest place value) can't be zero. So, for 1-digit numbers, the digit is from 1 to 6. For 2-digit numbers, the first digit is from 1 to 6, and the second digit is from 0 to 6. Similarly for 3-digit and 4-digit numbers.\n\nBut since we're excluding 4 and 5, each digit can only be 0,1,2,3,6. However, the first digit can't be zero, so for each digit position, we have different possibilities.\n\nLet me break this down by the number of digits:\n\n1-digit numbers: 1 to 6 in base 7, which is 1 to 6 in base 10. We need to count how many of these don't have 4 or 5. So, the digits allowed are 1,2,3,6. That's 4 options. So, N1 = 4.\n\n2-digit numbers: In base 7, a 2-digit number ranges from 10 (which is 7 in base 10) to 66 (which is 6*7 + 6 = 48 in base 10). Each 2-digit number has two digits: the first digit (from 1 to 6) and the second digit (from 0 to 6). But we're excluding 4 and 5, so each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. However, the first digit can't be zero, so it has 4 options (1,2,3,6), and the second digit has 5 options (0,1,2,3,6). So, N2 = 4 * 5 = 20.\n\n3-digit numbers: Similarly, a 3-digit number in base 7 ranges from 100 (which is 49 in base 10) to 666 (which is 342 in base 10). Each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6, but the first digit can't be zero. So, the first digit has 4 options, the second and third digits have 5 options each. So, N3 = 4 * 5 * 5 = 100.\n\n4-digit numbers: The only 4-digit number in our range is 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in base 10. As I noted earlier, 1000 in base 7 has digits 1,0,0,0, which don't include 4 or 5. So, N4 = 1.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. In base 7, 4-digit numbers go from 1000 to 6666, but in our case, we're only going up to 1000, which is 343 in base 10. So, the only 4-digit number is 1000, which doesn't have any 4s or 5s. So, N4 = 1.\n\nNow, adding them up: N = N1 + N2 + N3 + N4 = 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me verify this. So, N is the number of numbers from 1 to 343 (base 10) that, when written in base 7, have no 4s or 5s in any digit. So, N = 125.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 is total numbers (343) minus N (125), which is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 125 seems a bit low. Let me go through each digit count again.\n\n1-digit numbers: 1-6. Excluding 4 and 5, so allowed digits are 1,2,3,6. That's 4 numbers. So, N1=4. That seems correct.\n\n2-digit numbers: First digit (tens place in base 7) can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit (units place) can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So, 4*5=20. That seems correct.\n\n3-digit numbers: First digit: 4 options, second and third digits: 5 options each. So, 4*5*5=100. Correct.\n\n4-digit number: Only 1000, which is allowed, so 1. Correct.\n\nSo, total N = 4 + 20 + 100 +1 = 125.\n\nThus, the answer is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When we're dealing with numbers up to 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in base 10, we're considering all numbers from 1 to 343. So, in base 7, numbers with 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits.\n\nWait, but another way to calculate N is to consider each digit's possibilities without 4 or 5. So, for each digit position, except the first, the number of options is 5 (0,1,2,3,6), and for the first digit, it's 4 (1,2,3,6).\n\nBut since the numbers can have up to 4 digits, let's model it as all 4-digit numbers with leading zeros allowed, but then subtract the case where all digits are zero.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, we can model it as numbers with up to 3 digits, since 1000 is a separate case.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the number of numbers without any 4 or 5 in base 7 up to 3 digits (i.e., up to 666 in base 7, which is 342 in base 10) plus the number 1000 in base 7.\n\nSo, for 1-digit numbers: 4 options.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: 4*5 = 20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: 4*5*5=100.\n\nThen, 4-digit number: 1.\n\nTotal N = 4 + 20 + 100 +1 = 125.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the total numbers is 343, so the answer is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm including 0 in the count. Wait, the problem says positive integers, so 0 isn't included. So, when I calculate N, I have to make sure I'm only counting positive integers.\n\nIn my calculation, N is the count of positive integers from 1 to 343 that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is to model each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, allowing leading zeros, which would cover all numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7, which is 0 to 342 in base 10. Then, adding 1 for 1000 in base 7 (343 in base 10).\n\nBut in that case, the total numbers would be 343 (from 000 to 666) plus 1 (1000), but since we're only considering positive integers, we exclude 000, so 343 numbers from 001 to 666, which is 1 to 342, plus 1000, which is 343. So, total 343 numbers.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to model it as 4-digit numbers with leading zeros allowed, but then subtract the cases where numbers are longer than needed. Hmm, maybe not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for numbers without certain digits in each position.\n\nSo, for each digit, the number of options without 4 or 5 is:\n\n- For the first digit (if it's a 3-digit number or less), 4 options (1,2,3,6).\n\n- For other digits, 5 options (0,1,2,3,6).\n\nSo, the total number of such numbers with up to 3 digits is:\n\n- 1-digit: 4\n\n- 2-digit: 4*5=20\n\n- 3-digit: 4*5*5=100\n\nPlus the 4-digit number 1000, which is 1.\n\nTotal N=4+20+100+1=125.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 343 total numbers minus 125 without 4 or 5 gives 218 numbers that have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but let me check with a small example to see if this approach works.\n\nSuppose I take a smaller case, say base 2, and count how many numbers from 1 to 8 (which is 2^3) have at least one 1 in their binary representation. Well, in binary, numbers from 1 to 8 are 1 to 1000. The numbers without any 1s would only be 0, but since we're considering positive integers, the count would be 0. So, the answer would be 8 - 0 = 8, which is correct because every number from 1 to 8 in binary has at least one '1'.\n\nWait, that seems to check out.\n\nAnother example: base 3, numbers from 1 to 27 (3^3). How many have at least one digit 1 or 2? Wait, but in base 3, digits are 0,1,2. So, all numbers except 0 would have at least one digit that is 1 or 2. But since we're excluding 0, all numbers from 1 to 27 would have at least one digit that is 1 or 2, so the answer would be 27. But let's test the complementary counting.\n\nNumbers without any 1 or 2 in base 3: only 0, which isn't included, so N=0, so 27 - 0 =27, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let's try a case where we exclude some digits. For example, in base 3, how many numbers from 1 to 9 (which is 3^2) have no 1s or 2s? Well, only 0, but since we're considering positive integers, none. So, the answer would be 9 - 0=9 numbers that have at least one 1 or 2, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps a better example: base 4, numbers from 1 to 64 (4^3). How many have at least one 2 or 3.\n\nUsing complementary counting: numbers without 2 or 3 would have digits only 0 and 1. But since we're dealing with positive integers, the first digit can't be 0.\n\nSo, for 1-digit numbers: digits allowed are 1. So, N1=1.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit can be 1, second digit can be 0 or 1. So, 1*2=2.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit=1, second and third digits=0 or 1. So, 1*2*2=4.\n\n4-digit number: only 1000 in base 4, which is 64 in base 10, but in our range, we're considering up to 64, which is 1000 in base 4. So, N4=1.\n\nWait, but in base 4, 1000 is 64, which is included. So, total N=1+2+4+1=8.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers with at least one 2 or 3 would be 64 - 8=56.\n\nWait, but let me check by another method. For each digit, the number of options without 2 or 3 is:\n\n1-digit: 1 option (1).\n\n2-digit: 1 (first digit) * 2 (second digit) = 2.\n\n3-digit: 1*2*2=4.\n\n4-digit: 1.\n\nTotal N=8. So, 64 -8=56. That seems correct.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to our original problem, N=125, so the answer is 343 - 125=218.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 4-digit number in base 7. 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10. So, in our count of N, we included it because it doesn't have any 4s or 5s. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the problem as counting the numbers without 4 or 5 in any digit, which would be for each digit:\n\n- For the first digit (if it's a 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, or 4-digit number), the options are 1,2,3,6.\n\n- For other digits, options are 0,1,2,3,6.\n\nSo, the number of such numbers is:\n\nFor 1-digit: 4.\n\nFor 2-digit: 4*5.\n\nFor 3-digit: 4*5*5.\n\nFor 4-digit: 4*5*5*5, but wait, no. Because 1000 is the only 4-digit number, and in that case, the first digit is 1, and the rest are 0s. So, in that case, it's only 1 number, not 4*5*5*5.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused something here. Let me clarify.\n\nIn base 7, numbers with up to 3 digits can be represented as 3-digit numbers with leading zeros, which allows us to model each number as a 3-digit number where each digit can be 0-6, except the first digit can't be zero for positive integers.\n\nBut when we include 4-digit numbers, it's only 1000, which is 343 in base 10.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model all numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7 (which is 0 to 342 in base 10) plus 1000 (343). So, total 343 numbers.\n\nIn that case, the number of numbers without 4 or 5 in any digit would be:\n\n- For 000: not included as it's zero.\n\n- For numbers from 001 to 666: each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6, but first digit can't be zero.\n\nSo, for 1-digit: 1 to 6, allowed digits: 1,2,3,6 \u2192 4 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options) \u2192 4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit: first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 options each \u2192 4*5*5=100.\n\nPlus, the number 1000,",

So the digits in base 7 go from 0 to 6, and each position represents 7^0, 7^1, 7^2, etc. \n\nThe 343 smallest positive integers in base 7... wait, 343 is 7^3, so that would mean we're considering all the numbers from 1 up to 7^3, which is 343 in base 10. But when written in base 7, these numbers would range from 1 up to 1000_7, because 7^3 is 1000 in base 7. So, we're looking at all numbers with up to three digits in base 7, right? That would be numbers from 1 to 666_7, because 666_7 is equal to 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342 in base 10. So 343 in base 10 is 1000_7, but we're only considering up to 342, so numbers with 1, 2, or 3 digits in base 7.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" which would include 1 up to 343 in base 10. So, in base 7, that would include 1 up to 1000_7, which is a four-digit number. Hmm, but 1000_7 is 343 in base 10, so when written in base 7, it's the first four-digit number. So, do we include 1000_7 or not? Wait, the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" so that would be 1 to 343, including 343. So in base 7, that would be 1_7 up to 1000_7. So, that includes four-digit numbers in base 7, but only one four-digit number, which is 1000_7.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when we count the number of digits in base 7 up to 343, 343 is 7^3, so numbers from 1 to 7^3 -1 are three-digit numbers in base 7, and 7^3 is 1000_7, which is a four-digit number. So, when we include 343, which is 1000_7, we have four-digit numbers as well. So, the total numbers we're considering are from 1_7 up to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers in total.\n\nNow, the question is how many of these numbers use 4 or 5 or both as a digit. So, I think the approach here is to calculate the total number of such numbers and then subtract those that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit. So, it's a complementary counting problem. So, the total numbers are 343, and then the numbers that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit would be the ones where each digit is 0,1,2,3,6. But wait, wait a second, in base 7, the digits go from 0 to 6, so when we're considering positive integers, leading zeros are not allowed. So, when we count the numbers without 4 or 5, we have to consider how many digits each number has.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of digits. Let me try to model this. Let's consider numbers in base 7 with up to three digits, plus the four-digit number 1000_7. Wait, but 1000_7 is just one number, so maybe it's easier to handle separately.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to think of all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 7^3 = 343 numbers, including 000_7, which is 0 in base 10. But since we're considering positive integers, we should exclude 000_7, so we have 342 numbers from 1_7 up to 666_7, which is 342 in base 10, and then 343 is 1000_7. So, maybe it's better to include 1000_7 as a four-digit number. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider all numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, and convert them to base 7, then count how many of those have at least one 4 or 5 in their digits. So, maybe I can model this as a problem of counting how many numbers in base 7 (from 1 to 1000_7) have at least one digit that is 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is equal to the total numbers minus the numbers that have no 4s and no 5s.\n\nSo, total numbers: 343 (from 1 to 343 inclusive). Now, numbers with no 4s and no 5s: each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. But wait, in base 7, each digit can be from 0 to 6, but for numbers with d digits, the first digit can't be zero.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as numbers with up to three digits in base 7, and then include the four-digit number 1000_7.\n\nSo, let me break it down by the number of digits.\n\n1-digit numbers in base 7: 1 to 6. So, 6 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: from 10_7 (which is 7 in base 10) to 66_7 (which is 6*7 + 6 = 48 in base 10). So, that's 6*7 = 42 numbers.\n\n3-digit numbers: from 100_7 (49 in base 10) to 666_7 (342 in base 10). That's 6*7^2 = 294 numbers.\n\nPlus the 4-digit number: 1000_7 (343 in base 10), which is 1 number.\n\nSo, total numbers: 6 + 42 + 294 + 1 = 343, which matches.\n\nNow, for each category, let's count how many numbers have no 4s or 5s.\n\n1-digit numbers: digits allowed are 1,2,3,6. So, 4 options.\n\nWait, but wait: 1-digit numbers can't be zero, so digits allowed are 1,2,3,6. So, 4 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\n2-digit numbers: the first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), and the second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So, 4*5 = 20 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit: 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit: 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options), third digit: 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So, 4*5*5 = 100 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\n4-digit number: only 1000_7, which is 1 followed by three zeros. So, does this number have any 4 or 5? No, it's 1,0,0,0, so it doesn't have 4 or 5. So, that's 1 number without 4 or 5.\n\nSo, total numbers without 4 or 5: 4 (1-digit) + 20 (2-digit) + 100 (3-digit) + 1 (4-digit) = 125.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 is total numbers (343) minus numbers without 4 or 5 (125), which is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me check that again.\n\nWait, total numbers: 343.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nSo, 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the numbers without 4 or 5.\n\n1-digit numbers: 1,2,3,6: 4 numbers. Correct.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second digit 5 options, so 4*5=20. Correct.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 options each, so 4*5*5=100. Correct.\n\n4-digit number: only 1000_7, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so 1 number. Correct.\n\nSo total without 4 or 5: 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nThus, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Does 1000_7 count as a number that doesn't have 4 or 5? Yes, it's 1 followed by three zeros, so yes. So, including it in the count is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider 1000_7 separately, but I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nWait, but another approach: sometimes, when we count numbers with up to n digits, we might have to adjust for leading zeros, but in this case, since we're considering numbers from 1 to 343, which includes all numbers with 1, 2, 3, and 4 digits in base 7, I think the approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the counts again.\n\n1-digit numbers: 6 numbers in total (1-6). Numbers without 4 or 5: 4, so numbers with 4 or 5: 2 (which are 4 and 5). So, 2 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: 42 in total. Numbers without 4 or 5: 20. So numbers with 4 or 5: 42 - 20 = 22.\n\n3-digit numbers: 294 in total. Numbers without 4 or 5: 100. So numbers with 4 or 5: 294 - 100 = 194.\n\n4-digit number: 1 in total, which is 1000_7. It doesn't have 4 or 5, so numbers with 4 or 5: 0.\n\nSo total numbers with 4 or 5: 2 + 22 + 194 + 0 = 218.\n\nYes, that matches the previous total.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 2 (from 1-digit) + 22 (from 2-digit) = 24, plus 194 (from 3-digit) = 218, plus 0 from 4-digit. So, 218.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I count the numbers without 4 or 5, I included 1000_7, which is correct because it's part of the 343 numbers. So, the subtraction is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether 1000_7 is included in the 343 numbers. Since 343 is 1000_7, yes, it's included, so we have to consider it.\n\nWait, but perhaps another way to approach this problem is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times 4 or 5 appears, but that might be more complicated because the problem is about numbers that have at least one 4 or 5, not the total number of digits that are 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nWait, another way: think of each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, padding with leading zeros to make it 3 digits, and then 1000_7 as a separate case. So, for numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, including 000_7. But since we're considering positive integers from 1 to 343, we can exclude 000_7, so 342 numbers, plus 1000_7, making 343.\n\nIn that case, for 3-digit numbers (including leading zeros), the count without 4 or 5 would be 5 options for each digit (0,1,2,3,6), so 5^3 = 125. But wait, that includes 000_7, which is 0, so if we exclude it, we have 124 numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 666_7. Then, adding 1000_7, which is another number without 4 or 5, so total without 4 or 5 is 125. Which matches the earlier count.\n\nThus, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me just check with a small example to see if the approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I take base 7 numbers from 1 to 7^2 = 49, so up to 66_7.\n\nTotal numbers: 49.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: 1-digit: 4 numbers (1,2,3,6).\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second digit 5 options, so 4*5=20.\n\nTotal without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 = 24.\n\nThus, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 49 - 24 = 25.\n\nWait, let me count manually.\n\nNumbers from 1 to 66_7 (which is 48 in base 10).\n\n1-digit: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, 2 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: from 10_7 (7) to 66_7 (48).\n\nNow, how many 2-digit base 7 numbers have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nWe can calculate it as total 2-digit numbers: 6*7=42.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: first digit 4 options (1,2,3,6), second digit 5 options (0,1,2,3,6). So, 4*5=20.\n\nThus, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 42 - 20 = 22.\n\nSo, total numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 2 (from 1-digit) + 22 (from 2-digit) = 24.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 25. Wait, no, 49 - 24 = 25, but when I count manually, I get 2 + 22 = 24. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the small example.\n\nWait, total numbers from 1 to 49 (base 10) is 49 numbers.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: 4 (1-digit) + 20 (2-digit) = 24.\n\nThus, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 49 - 24 = 25.\n\nBut when I count manually, I get 2 (from 1-digit) + 22 (from 2-digit) = 24.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe the 1000_7 is included in the 343 numbers, but in the small example, 49 is 100_7, which is 49 in base 10. Wait, no, 49 is 100_7. Wait, no, 49 in base 10 is 100_7, which is a 3-digit number.\n\nWait, so in the small example, up to 49, which is 100_7, so it's a 3-digit number. So, perhaps in the small example, I should include the 3-digit number 100_7 as well.\n\nWait, let me redo the small example correctly.\n\nNumbers from 1 to 49 (base 10), which is 1 to 100_7.\n\nSo, numbers are:\n\n1-digit: 1 to 6 (6 numbers).\n\n2-digit: 10_7 (7) to 66_7 (48) (42 numbers).\n\n3-digit: 100_7 (49) (1 number).\n\nTotal: 6 + 42 + 1 = 49.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5:\n\n1-digit: 4 numbers (1,2,3,6).\n\n2-digit: first digit 4 options, second digit 5 options, so 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit: first digit 1 (since it's 100_7), but wait, 100_7 is 1 followed by two zeros. So, it doesn't have 4 or 5, so that's 1 number.\n\nThus, total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 1 = 25.\n\nThus, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 49 - 25 = 24.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 25. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, let me count manually:\n\n1-digit: numbers with 4 or 5: 4 and 5, so 2 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: let's see how many have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nTotal 2-digit numbers: 42.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: 4*5=20.\n\nThus, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 42 - 20 = 22.\n\n3-digit number: 100_7, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so 0 numbers.\n\nThus, total numbers with 4 or 5: 2 + 22 + 0 = 24.\n\nWhich matches the total of 49 - 25 = 24.\n\nSo, in this small example, the approach works correctly.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, the approach is correct, so 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but in the small example, I had 49 - 25 = 24, which matched the manual count, so I think the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 218.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of integers is \\boxed{218}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit, we can use complementary counting. \n\n1. **Total Numbers**: The 343 smallest positive integers in base 10 correspond to numbers from 1 to 343. In base 7, this includes numbers from 1 to 1000_7 (which is 343 in base 10).\n\n2. **Numbers Without 4 or 5**: We count numbers that do not contain the digits 4 or 5 in any position. \n   - **",
    "full_cot": "Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 or both. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. First, base 7 numbers. Base 7 means that each digit represents a power of 7, right? So the digits in base 7 go from 0 to 6, and each position represents 7^0, 7^1, 7^2, etc. \n\nThe 343 smallest positive integers in base 7... wait, 343 is 7^3, so that would mean we're considering all the numbers from 1 up to 7^3, which is 343 in base 10. But when written in base 7, these numbers would range from 1 up to 1000_7, because 7^3 is 1000 in base 7. So, we're looking at all numbers with up to three digits in base 7, right? That would be numbers from 1 to 666_7, because 666_7 is equal to 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342 in base 10. So 343 in base 10 is 1000_7, but we're only considering up to 342, so numbers with 1, 2, or 3 digits in base 7.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" which would include 1 up to 343 in base 10. So, in base 7, that would include 1 up to 1000_7, which is a four-digit number. Hmm, but 1000_7 is 343 in base 10, so when written in base 7, it's the first four-digit number. So, do we include 1000_7 or not? Wait, the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" so that would be 1 to 343, including 343. So in base 7, that would be 1_7 up to 1000_7. So, that includes four-digit numbers in base 7, but only one four-digit number, which is 1000_7.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when we count the number of digits in base 7 up to 343, 343 is 7^3, so numbers from 1 to 7^3 -1 are three-digit numbers in base 7, and 7^3 is 1000_7, which is a four-digit number. So, when we include 343, which is 1000_7, we have four-digit numbers as well. So, the total numbers we're considering are from 1_7 up to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers in total.\n\nNow, the question is how many of these numbers use 4 or 5 or both as a digit. So, I think the approach here is to calculate the total number of such numbers and then subtract those that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit. So, it's a complementary counting problem. So, the total numbers are 343, and then the numbers that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit would be the ones where each digit is 0,1,2,3,6. But wait, wait a second, in base 7, the digits go from 0 to 6, so when we're considering positive integers, leading zeros are not allowed. So, when we count the numbers without 4 or 5, we have to consider how many digits each number has.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of digits. Let me try to model this. Let's consider numbers in base 7 with up to three digits, plus the four-digit number 1000_7. Wait, but 1000_7 is just one number, so maybe it's easier to handle separately.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to think of all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 7^3 = 343 numbers, including 000_7, which is 0 in base 10. But since we're considering positive integers, we should exclude 000_7, so we have 342 numbers from 1_7 up to 666_7, which is 342 in base 10, and then 343 is 1000_7. So, maybe it's better to include 1000_7 as a four-digit number. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider all numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, and convert them to base 7, then count how many of those have at least one 4 or 5 in their digits. So, maybe I can model this as a problem of counting how many numbers in base 7 (from 1 to 1000_7) have at least one digit that is 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is equal to the total numbers minus the numbers that have no 4s and no 5s.\n\nSo, total numbers: 343 (from 1 to 343 inclusive). Now, numbers with no 4s and no 5s: each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. But wait, in base 7, each digit can be from 0 to 6, but for numbers with d digits, the first digit can't be zero.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as numbers with up to three digits in base 7, and then include the four-digit number 1000_7.\n\nSo, let me break it down by the number of digits.\n\n1-digit numbers in base 7: 1 to 6. So, 6 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: from 10_7 (which is 7 in base 10) to 66_7 (which is 6*7 + 6 = 48 in base 10). So, that's 6*7 = 42 numbers.\n\n3-digit numbers: from 100_7 (49 in base 10) to 666_7 (342 in base 10). That's 6*7^2 = 294 numbers.\n\nPlus the 4-digit number: 1000_7 (343 in base 10), which is 1 number.\n\nSo, total numbers: 6 + 42 + 294 + 1 = 343, which matches.\n\nNow, for each category, let's count how many numbers have no 4s or 5s.\n\n1-digit numbers: digits allowed are 1,2,3,6. So, 4 options.\n\nWait, but wait: 1-digit numbers can't be zero, so digits allowed are 1,2,3,6. So, 4 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\n2-digit numbers: the first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), and the second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So, 4*5 = 20 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit: 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit: 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options), third digit: 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So, 4*5*5 = 100 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\n4-digit number: only 1000_7, which is 1 followed by three zeros. So, does this number have any 4 or 5? No, it's 1,0,0,0, so it doesn't have 4 or 5. So, that's 1 number without 4 or 5.\n\nSo, total numbers without 4 or 5: 4 (1-digit) + 20 (2-digit) + 100 (3-digit) + 1 (4-digit) = 125.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 is total numbers (343) minus numbers without 4 or 5 (125), which is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me check that again.\n\nWait, total numbers: 343.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nSo, 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the numbers without 4 or 5.\n\n1-digit numbers: 1,2,3,6: 4 numbers. Correct.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second digit 5 options, so 4*5=20. Correct.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 options each, so 4*5*5=100. Correct.\n\n4-digit number: only 1000_7, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so 1 number. Correct.\n\nSo total without 4 or 5: 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nThus, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Does 1000_7 count as a number that doesn't have 4 or 5? Yes, it's 1 followed by three zeros, so yes. So, including it in the count is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider 1000_7 separately, but I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nWait, but another approach: sometimes, when we count numbers with up to n digits, we might have to adjust for leading zeros, but in this case, since we're considering numbers from 1 to 343, which includes all numbers with 1, 2, 3, and 4 digits in base 7, I think the approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the counts again.\n\n1-digit numbers: 6 numbers in total (1-6). Numbers without 4 or 5: 4, so numbers with 4 or 5: 2 (which are 4 and 5). So, 2 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: 42 in total. Numbers without 4 or 5: 20. So numbers with 4 or 5: 42 - 20 = 22.\n\n3-digit numbers: 294 in total. Numbers without 4 or 5: 100. So numbers with 4 or 5: 294 - 100 = 194.\n\n4-digit number: 1 in total, which is 1000_7. It doesn't have 4 or 5, so numbers with 4 or 5: 0.\n\nSo total numbers with 4 or 5: 2 + 22 + 194 + 0 = 218.\n\nYes, that matches the previous total.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 2 (from 1-digit) + 22 (from 2-digit) = 24, plus 194 (from 3-digit) = 218, plus 0 from 4-digit. So, 218.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I count the numbers without 4 or 5, I included 1000_7, which is correct because it's part of the 343 numbers. So, the subtraction is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether 1000_7 is included in the 343 numbers. Since 343 is 1000_7, yes, it's included, so we have to consider it.\n\nWait, but perhaps another way to approach this problem is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times 4 or 5 appears, but that might be more complicated because the problem is about numbers that have at least one 4 or 5, not the total number of digits that are 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nWait, another way: think of each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, padding with leading zeros to make it 3 digits, and then 1000_7 as a separate case. So, for numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, including 000_7. But since we're considering positive integers from 1 to 343, we can exclude 000_7, so 342 numbers, plus 1000_7, making 343.\n\nIn that case, for 3-digit numbers (including leading zeros), the count without 4 or 5 would be 5 options for each digit (0,1,2,3,6), so 5^3 = 125. But wait, that includes 000_7, which is 0, so if we exclude it, we have 124 numbers without 4 or 5 from 1 to 666_7. Then, adding 1000_7, which is another number without 4 or 5, so total without 4 or 5 is 125. Which matches the earlier count.\n\nThus, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me just check with a small example to see if the approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I take base 7 numbers from 1 to 7^2 = 49, so up to 66_7.\n\nTotal numbers: 49.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: 1-digit: 4 numbers (1,2,3,6).\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second digit 5 options, so 4*5=20.\n\nTotal without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 = 24.\n\nThus, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 49 - 24 = 25.\n\nWait, let me count manually.\n\nNumbers from 1 to 66_7 (which is 48 in base 10).\n\n1-digit: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Wait, no, 49 - 24 = 25, but when I count manually, I get 2 + 22 = 24. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the small example.\n\nWait, total numbers from 1 to 49 (base 10) is 49 numbers.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: 4 (1-digit) + 20 (2-digit) = 24.\n\nThus, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 49 - 24 = 25.\n\nBut when I count manually, I get 2 (from 1-digit) + 22 (from 2-digit) = 24.\n\nWait, that's a problem.

So we're looking at numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, but when written in base 7, they go from 1_7 up to 1000_7. Wait, but actually, in base 7, the number 343 would be 1000_7, right? So the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be 1_7 up to 666_7, because 666_7 is 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342, and then 343 would be 1000_7.

Let me think again. In base 7, each number is represented with digits, and the maximum number of digits needed for 343 would be four digits, because 7^3 is 343, so numbers from 0 to 342 can be represented in up to three digits in base 7, and 343 is 1000_7, which is four digits.

So I need to count all numbers in base 7 from 1_7 to 1000_7 where at least one digit is 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, it's easier sometimes to calculate the total number of numbers and subtract those that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit. So total numbers are 343. The numbers that don't have 4 or 5 as any digit would be numbers where each digit is 0,1,2,3,6. But since we're dealing with positive integers, the leading digit can't be zero. Hmm, so maybe I should model this as counting the number of 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers in base 7 that don't have 4 or 5, and then subtract that from the total 343.\n\nWait, but in base 7, the numbers from 1 to 343 can be represented as 1 to 1000_7. So let me think of each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, padding with leading zeros if necessary. For example, the number 1 would be 001_7, 7 would be 010_7, and so on. This way, every number can be considered as a 3-digit number, and 343 is 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number. Hmm, maybe it's better to handle 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers separately.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, but since we're only considering positive integers, we exclude 000_7, so we have 342 numbers. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, where each digit can be 0-6, but leading zeros are allowed, except that the number 000 is excluded because we're only considering positive integers. Wait, no, because 000 isn't a positive integer, so the numbers go from 001_7 to 666_7, which is 342 numbers, but in our case, we're considering up to 1000_7, which is 343, so maybe including 1000_7 as a 4-digit number.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try a different approach. Let's model each number as a 3-digit base 7 number, with leading zeros allowed, so that each number from 000_7 to 666_7 corresponds to 0 to 342 in base 10. Then, 343 is 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number. So, the total numbers we're considering are 343, from 1_7 (which is 1 in base 10) up to 1000_7 (which is 343 in base 10). So, to include 1000_7, I might need to consider 4-digit numbers as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider all numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, convert each to base 7, and count how many have at least one digit as 4 or 5. But that might be tedious, so perhaps using combinatorics is better.\n\nWait, another approach: The total number of numbers is 343. The number of numbers that do NOT have any 4 or 5 digits is equal to the number of numbers where each digit is 0,1,2,3,6. But we have to consider numbers with different digit lengths.\n\nWait, but since we're dealing with numbers up to 343, which is 1000_7, perhaps it's better to model numbers with up to 4 digits in base 7. Wait, no, because 343 is 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number. So perhaps we can model numbers as 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers in base 7.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to model each number as a 3-digit number, allowing leading zeros, so that each number from 000_7 to 666_7 is considered, but since we're dealing with positive integers, we exclude 000_7. Then, the number 343 is 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number, so perhaps we need to include that as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider numbers with 1, 2, 3, and 4 digits in base 7. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, 1-digit numbers in base 7: 1 to 6. There are 6 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: from 10_7 to 66_7. The first digit can be 1-6, and the second digit can be 0-6. So that's 6*7=42 numbers.\n\n3-digit numbers: from 100_7 to 666_7. The first digit 1-6, second 0-6, third 0-6. So 6*7*7=294 numbers.\n\n4-digit numbers: only 1000_7, which is 343 in base 10.\n\nSo total numbers: 6 + 42 + 294 + 1 = 343. That checks out.\n\nNow, I need to count how many of these numbers have at least one digit that is 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, it's easier to calculate the total numbers without any 4 or 5 digits and subtract that from the total.\n\nSo, total numbers without any 4 or 5 digits: For each digit position, the possible digits are 0,1,2,3,6. So, 5 choices for each digit, except for the first digit, which cannot be zero (since we're dealing with positive integers).\n\nWait, but for numbers with different digit lengths, the first digit cannot be zero.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers without any 4 or 5.\n\n1-digit numbers: digits are 1-6, but excluding 4 and 5. So allowed digits are 1,2,3,6. That's 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5=20 numbers.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second and third digits 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices each). So 4*5*5=100 numbers.\n\n4-digit numbers: only 1000_7, which is 343 in base 10. Now, does 1000_7 have any 4 or 5? The digits are 1,0,0,0. So no, it doesn't have 4 or 5. So in the count of numbers without 4 or 5, 1000_7 is included. But wait, 1000_7 is a 4-digit number, but in our case, we're considering positive integers up to 343, which includes 1000_7. So, the 4-digit number 1000_7 doesn't have any 4 or 5, so it's included in the count.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that the 4-digit numbers only include 1000_7, which is 343. So, for the 4-digit numbers without 4 or 5, it's just 1 number: 1000_7.\n\nSo, total numbers without any 4 or 5 digits: 4 (1-digit) + 20 (2-digit) + 100 (3-digit) + 1 (4-digit) = 125 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For 1-digit: 4 numbers. For 2-digit: 4*5=20. For 3-digit: 4*5*5=100. For 4-digit: only 1000_7, which is allowed because it doesn't have 4 or 5. So total is 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because in base 7, numbers are from 1_7 to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers. So, if there are 125 numbers without any 4 or 5, then the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 would be 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nWait, for 1-digit numbers, digits allowed are 1,2,3,6, so 4 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: first digit 4 choices, second and third digits 5 choices each, so 4*5*5=100.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: only 1000_7, which is allowed because it's 1 followed by three zeros, which don't include 4 or 5. So that's 1 number.\n\nSo total without 4 or 5: 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nThus, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is 343 the correct total? Because 1 to 343 inclusive is 343 numbers, right? So 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me check if I included 1000_7 correctly. 1000_7 is 343 in base 10, and it's included in the 343 numbers. Since it doesn't have any 4 or 5, it's part of the 125 numbers without 4 or 5. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the 3-digit numbers, when we consider numbers from 100_7 to 666_7, which is 294 numbers, but when we count the numbers without 4 or 5, we have 4*5*5=100. But does that include 100_7 itself? Let me check.\n\n100_7 is 49 in base 10, and it's allowed because digits are 1,0,0, which don't include 4 or 5. So yes, it's included in the count.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The number of 3-digit base 7 numbers without 4 or 5 is 4*5*5=100. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 2-digit numbers, 4*5=20, which includes numbers like 10_7, 11_7, etc., up to 66_7, but excluding those with 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but let me think: When I count 4*5*5 for 3-digit numbers, I'm including numbers where the first digit is 1,2,3,6; second digit 0,1,2,3,6; third digit 0,1,2,3,6. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total numbers without any 4 or 5 is 125, so the numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let me calculate directly how many numbers have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nFor 1-digit numbers: digits 4 and 5 are present. So numbers with 4 or 5: 2 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: Let's calculate how many have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nTotal 2-digit numbers: 42.\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5: 4*5=20.\n\nSo numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 42 - 20 = 22.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: Total 294.\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5: 4*5*5=100.\n\nSo numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 294 - 100 = 194.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: Only 1000_7, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so 0 numbers here.\n\nAdding up: 2 (1-digit) + 22 (2-digit) + 194 (3-digit) + 0 (4-digit) = 218.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the number of 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 that use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit is 218.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nWait, 1-digit: 2 numbers (4 and 5).\n\n2-digit: 22 numbers. So total so far: 24.\n\n3-digit: 194. So total becomes 24 + 194 = 218.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way: The total numbers with at least one 4 or 5 in any digit.\n\nFor 1-digit: 2.\n\nFor 2-digit: Let's calculate directly.\n\nFirst digit can be 4 or 5, and second digit can be anything. So that's 2*7=14.\n\nPlus, first digit not 4 or 5, but second digit is 4 or 5. So that's 4 choices for first digit (1,2,3,6), and 2 choices for second digit (4,5), so 4*2=8.\n\nTotal 2-digit numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 14 + 8 = 22. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, for 3-digit numbers.\n\nNumbers where first digit is 4 or 5: 2 choices, and the other two digits can be anything: 2*7*7=98.\n\nNumbers where first digit is not 4 or 5, but at least one of the other two digits is 4 or 5.\n\nSo, first digit: 4 choices (1,2,3,6).\n\nNow, for the other two digits, total possibilities: 7*7=49.\n\nNumber of possibilities where neither of the two digits is 4 or 5: 5*5=25.\n\nSo, the number of possibilities where at least one of the two digits is 4 or 5: 49 - 25=24.\n\nThus, for each first digit, we have 24 possibilities. So total for this case: 4*24=96.\n\nThus, total 3-digit numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 98 + 96=194. That matches.\n\nSo, adding up: 2 + 22 + 194 = 218.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 218.\n\nBut wait, let me just make sure that I didn't count 1000_7 in the 3-digit numbers. Because 1000_7 is a 4-digit number, so in the 3-digit numbers, we only go up to 666_7, which is 342 in base 10. So, 1000_7 is a separate 4-digit number, and it doesn't have any 4 or 5, so it's not included in the count of numbers with 4 or 5. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I considered numbers up to 1000_7, which is 343, and in that case, the total is 343 numbers. So, when I subtract the 125 numbers without 4 or 5, I get 218 numbers with at least one 4 or 5. So that seems consistent.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident the answer is 218.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of integers is \\boxed{218}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit, we start by considering the range from 1 to 343 in base 10, which corresponds to numbers from 1_7 to 1000_7 in base 7.\n\nWe need to count the numbers that have at least one digit as 4 or 5. Instead of counting these directly, we calculate the total number of numbers that do not have any 4 or 5 as a digit and subtract this from the total number of numbers (343).\n\n1. **Total numbers**: 343 (from 1 to 343 in base 10).\n\n2. **Numbers without any 4 or 5",
    "full_cot": "Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 or both. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. First, base 7 numbers. Base 7 means that each digit represents a power of 7, right? So the digits go from 0 to 6, just like in base 10 they go from 0 to 9.\n\nNow, the 343 smallest positive integers. Since 343 is 7 cubed, that makes me think that in base 7, these numbers would be from 1 up to 1000_7, because 1000_7 is equal to 7^3 = 343 in base 10. So we're looking at numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, but when written in base 7, they go from 1_7 up to 1000_7. Wait, but actually, in base 7, the number 343 would be 1000_7, right? So the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be 1_7 up to 666_7, because 666_7 is 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342, and then 343 would be 1000_7. So actually, the numbers go up to 1000_7, but since we're considering the smallest 343 positive integers, that would be 1_7 to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. In base 7, each number is represented with digits, and the maximum number of digits needed for 343 would be four digits, because 7^3 is 343, so numbers from 0 to 342 can be represented in up to three digits in base 7, and 343 is 1000_7, which is four digits. But since we're considering positive integers starting from 1, up to 343, which is 1000_7, I need to count all numbers from 1_7 up to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers.\n\nWait, but actually, 1000_7 is 343 in base 10, so that's the 343rd number. So yes, the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be from 1_7 up to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers.\n\nNow, the problem is asking how many of these numbers use 4 or 5 or both as a digit. So I need to count all numbers in base 7 from 1_7 to 1000_7 where at least one digit is 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, it's easier sometimes to calculate the total number of numbers and subtract those that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit. So total numbers are 343. The numbers that don't have 4 or 5 as any digit would be numbers where each digit is 0,1,2,3,6. But since we're dealing with positive integers, the leading digit can't be zero. Hmm, so maybe I should model this as counting the number of 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers in base 7 that don't have 4 or 5, and then subtract that from the total 343.\n\nWait, but in base 7, the numbers from 1 to 343 can be represented as 1 to 1000_7. So let me think of each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, padding with leading zeros if necessary. For example, the number 1 would be 001_7, 7 would be 010_7, and so on. This way, every number can be considered as a 3-digit number, and 343 is 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number. Hmm, maybe it's better to handle 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers separately.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, but since we're only considering positive integers, we exclude 000_7, so we have 342 numbers. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, where each digit can be 0-6, but leading zeros are allowed, except that the number 000 is excluded because we're only considering positive integers.

So, to include 1000_7, I might need to consider 4-digit numbers as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider all numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, convert each to base 7, and count how many have at least one digit as 4 or 5.

Wait, no, because 343 is 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number. So perhaps we can model numbers as 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers in base 7.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to model each number as a 3-digit number, allowing leading zeros, so that each number from 000_7 to 666_7 is considered, but since we're dealing with positive integers, we exclude 000_7. Then, the number 343 is 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number, so perhaps we need to include that as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider numbers with 1, 2, 3, and 4 digits in base 7. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, 1-digit numbers in base 7: 1 to 6. There are 6 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: from 10_7 to 66_7. The first digit can be 1-6, and the second digit can be 0-6. So that's 6*7=42 numbers.\n\n3-digit numbers: from 100_7 to 666_7. The first digit 1-6, second 0-6, third 0-6. So 6*7*7=294 numbers.\n\n4-digit numbers: only 1000_7, which is 343 in base 10.\n\nSo total numbers: 6 + 42 + 294 + 1 = 343. That checks out.\n\nNow, I need to count how many of these numbers have at least one digit that is 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, it's easier to calculate the total numbers without any 4 or 5 digits and subtract that from the total.\n\nSo, total numbers without any 4 or 5 digits: For each digit position, the possible digits are 0,1,2,3,6. So, 5 choices for each digit, except for the first digit, which cannot be zero (since we're dealing with positive integers).\n\nWait, but for numbers with different digit lengths, the first digit cannot be zero.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers without any 4 or 5.\n\n1-digit numbers: digits are 1-6, but excluding 4 and 5. So allowed digits are 1,2,3,6. That's 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5=20 numbers.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second and third digits 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices each). So 4*5*5=100 numbers.\n\n4-digit numbers: only 1000_7, which is 343 in base 10. Now, does 1000_7 have any 4 or 5? The digits are 1,0,0,0. So no, it doesn't have 4 or 5. So in the count of numbers without 4 or 5, 1000_7 is included. But wait, 1000_7 is a 4-digit number, but in our case, we're considering positive integers up to 343, which includes 1000_7. So, the 4-digit number 1000_7 doesn't have any 4 or 5, so it's included in the count.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that the 4-digit numbers only include 1000_7, which is 343. So, for the 4-digit numbers without 4 or 5, it's just 1 number: 1000_7.\n\nSo, total numbers without any 4 or 5 digits: 4 (1-digit) + 20 (2-digit) + 100 (3-digit) + 1 (4-digit) = 125 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For 1-digit: 4 numbers. For 2-digit: 4*5=20. For 3-digit: 4*5*5=100. For 4-digit: only 1000_7, which is allowed because it doesn't have 4 or 5. So total is 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because in base 7, numbers are from 1_7 to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers. So, if there are 125 numbers without any 4 or 5, then the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 would be 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nWait, for 1-digit numbers, digits allowed are 1,2,3,6, so 4 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: first digit 4 choices, second and third digits 5 choices each, so 4*5*5=100.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: only 1000_7, which is allowed because it's 1 followed by three zeros, which don't include 4 or 5. So that's 1 number.\n\nSo total without 4 or 5: 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nThus, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is 343 the correct total? Because 1 to 343 inclusive is 343 numbers, right? So 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me check if I included 1000_7 correctly. 1000_7 is 343 in base 10, and it's included in the 343 numbers. Since it doesn't have any 4 or 5, it's part of the 125 numbers without 4 or 5. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the 3-digit numbers, when we consider numbers from 100_7 to 666_7, which is 294 numbers, but when we count the numbers without 4 or 5, we have 4*5*5=100. But does that include 100_7 itself? Let me check.\n\n100_7 is 49 in base 10, and it's allowed because digits are 1,0,0, which don't include 4 or 5. So yes, it's included in the count.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The number of 3-digit base 7 numbers without 4 or 5 is 4*5*5=100. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 2-digit numbers, 4*5=20, which includes numbers like 10_7, 11_7, etc., up to 66_7, but excluding those with 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but let me think: When I count 4*5*5 for 3-digit numbers, I'm including numbers where the first digit is 1,2,3,6; second digit 0,1,2,3,6; third digit 0,1,2,3,6. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total numbers without any 4 or 5 is 125, so the numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let me calculate directly how many numbers have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nFor 1-digit numbers: digits 4 and 5 are present. So numbers with 4 or 5: 2 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: Let's calculate how many have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nTotal 2-digit numbers: 42.\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5: 4*5=20.\n\nSo numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 42 - 20 = 22.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: Total 294.\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5: 4*5*5=100.\n\nSo numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 294 - 100 = 194.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: Only 1000_7, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so 0 numbers here.\n\nAdding up: 2 (1-digit) + 22 (2-digit) + 194 (3-digit) + 0 (4-digit) = 218.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the number of 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 that use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit is 218.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nWait, 1-digit: 2 numbers (4 and 5).\n\n2-digit: 22 numbers. So total so far: 24.\n\n3-digit: 194. So total becomes 24 + 194 = 218.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way: The total numbers with at least one 4 or 5 in any digit.\n\nFor 1-digit: 2.\n\nFor 2-digit: Let's calculate directly.\n\nFirst digit can be 4 or 5, and second digit can be anything. So that's 2*7=14.\n\nPlus, first digit not 4 or 5, but second digit is 4 or 5. So that's 4 choices for first digit (1,2,3,6), and 2 choices for second digit (4,5), so 4*2=8.\n\nTotal 2-digit numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 14 + 8 = 22. That matches.\n\nSimilarly, for 3-digit numbers.\n\nNumbers where first digit is 4 or 5: 2 choices, and the other two digits can be anything: 2*7*7=98.\n\nNumbers where first digit is not 4 or 5, but at least one of the other two digits is 4 or 5.\n\nSo, first digit: 4 choices (1,2,3,6).\n\nNow, for the other two digits, total possibilities: 7*7=49.\n\nNumber of possibilities where neither of the two digits is 4 or 5: 5*5=25.\n\nSo, the number of possibilities where at least one of the two digits is 4 or 5: 49 - 25=24.\n\nThus, for each first digit, we have 24 possibilities. So total for this case: 4*24=96.\n\nThus, total 3-digit numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 98 + 96=194. That matches.\n\nSo, adding up: 2 + 22 + 194 = 218.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 218.\n\nBut wait, let me just make sure that I didn't count 1000_7 in the 3-digit numbers. Because 1000_7 is a 4-digit number, so in the 3-digit numbers, we only go up to 666_7, which is 342 in base 10. So, 1000_7 is a separate 4-digit number, and it doesn't have any 4 or 5, so it's not included in the count of numbers with 4 or 5. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I considered numbers up to 1000_7, which is 343, and in that case, the total is 343 numbers. So, when I subtract the 125 numbers without 4 or 5, I get 218 numbers with at least one 4 or 5. So that seems consistent.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident the answer is 218.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of integers is \\boxed{218}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit, we start by considering the range from 1 to 343 in base 10, which corresponds to numbers from 1_7 to 1000_7 in base 7.\n\nWe need to count the numbers that have at least one digit as 4 or 5. Instead of counting these directly, we calculate the total number of numbers that do not have any 4 or 5 as a digit and subtract this from the total number of numbers (343).\n\n1. **Total numbers**: 343 (from 1 to 343 in base 10).\n\n2. **Numbers without any 4 or 5",
