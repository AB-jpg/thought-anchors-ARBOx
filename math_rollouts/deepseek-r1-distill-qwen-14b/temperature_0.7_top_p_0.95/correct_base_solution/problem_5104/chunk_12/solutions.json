Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. First, base 7 numbers. Base 7 digits go from 0 to 6, right? So each digit in a base 7 number can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The problem is asking about numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 in any of their digits. And we're considering the 343 smallest positive integers. Wait, 343... that's 7 cubed, right? So 7^3 = 343. That makes sense because in base 7, the numbers go from 1 up to 666_7, which is 342 in decimal. Wait, no, hold on.",

    "rollout": " 666 in base 7 is 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342. So the 343rd number would be 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal. But the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so that would be from 1 to 343 in decimal. But when written in base 7, these would be from 1_7 up to 1000_7. Hmm, but 1000_7 is 343, so the numbers we're considering are 1_7 to 1000_7 in base 7, which are 1 to 343 in decimal. \n\nNow, the question is how many of these numbers have at least one digit that is 4 or 5. So, to solve this, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of such numbers and subtract those that don't have any 4 or 5. That is, using complementary counting. So total numbers is 343, and then subtract the numbers that only have digits 0,1,2,3,6 in each digit.\n\nBut wait, in base 7, the numbers from 1 to 342 are 1 to 666_7, and 343 is 1000_7. So perhaps it's better to consider numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which are 0 to 342 in decimal, and then include 343. Wait, but the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so 1 to 343. So maybe I should adjust for that. Let me clarify.\n\nIn base 7, the number 0 is not a positive integer, so the first positive integer is 1_7, which is 1 in decimal. The number 343 in decimal is 1000_7, which is the next number after 666_7 (which is 342 decimal). So the 343 numbers are 1_7 to 1000_7. But 1000_7 has four digits, while the others up to 666_7 have up to three digits. Hmm, this might complicate things a bit because some numbers have three digits and some have four digits.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of all numbers as three-digit numbers in base 7 by padding with leading zeros. So 000_7 is 0, which isn't positive, but 001_7 is 1, up to 666_7 which is 342, and then 1000_7 is 343. So the 343 numbers would be from 001_7 to 1000_7. But I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to consider numbers with 1, 2, or 3 digits in base 7 and then handle the 4-digit number 1000_7 separately. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, let's find how many 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers in base 7 use at least one 4 or 5. Then, check if 1000_7 has a 4 or 5; it doesn't, since it's 1 followed by three 0s. So it only contributes 1 to the total, but doesn't have any 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" which are 1 to 343 in decimal. So 1000_7 is included, which is 343, and it's a 4-digit number. So perhaps it's better to consider numbers from 1 to 666_7 (342 decimal) as 1 to 3-digit numbers, and then include 1000_7 (343) as a separate case.\n\nWait, but let me get back to the problem. Maybe using complementary counting is the way to go. So, the total number of positive integers we're considering is 343. We need to find how many of these have at least one 4 or 5 in their base 7 representation. So, the complement would be the numbers that have no 4s and no 5s in any digit. So, if I can calculate how many numbers have only digits from {0,1,2,3,6}, then subtract that from 343 to get the desired count.\n\nBut wait, in base 7, the digits allowed are 0 to 6. So, if we exclude 4 and 5, the allowed digits are 0,1,2,3,6. That's 5 digits. Now, for each digit in a number, the number of possibilities without 4 or 5 would be 5 choices per digit. But we have to consider numbers with different lengths.\n\nWait, but in base 7, the numbers from 1 to 342 can be 1, 2, or 3 digits. Let me think in terms of 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers, and then handle 1000_7 separately.\n\nSo, first, for 1-digit numbers: in base 7, 1-digit numbers are from 1 to 6. So, how many of these have at least one 4 or 5? Well, the digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6. So the numbers that have 4 or 5 are 4 and 5. So that's 2 numbers. So, count is 2.\n\nNow, for 2-digit numbers: in base 7, 2-digit numbers go from 10_7 (which is 7 decimal) to 66_7 (which is 48 decimal). So, how many 2-digit base 7 numbers have at least one 4 or 5? Again, using complementary counting, total 2-digit numbers in base 7: the first digit can be 1-6 (since leading zero isn't allowed), and the second digit can be 0-6. So total 6*7=42 numbers. Now, the number of 2-digit numbers without 4 or 5: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (so 4 choices), and second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5=20 numbers without 4 or 5. So the number with at least one 4 or 5 is 42-20=22.\n\nWait, but let me check: 4 choices for first digit (1,2,3,6), and 5 choices for second digit (0,1,2,3,6). So 4*5=20 without 4 or 5, so 42-20=22 with at least one 4 or 5. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for 3-digit numbers: in base 7, 3-digit numbers go from 100_7 (49 decimal) to 666_7 (342 decimal). The total number of 3-digit numbers in base 7 is 6*7*7=294. Now, how many of these have no 4 or 5? So, first digit: 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit: 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices), third digit: same as second digit, 5 choices. So total without 4 or 5 is 4*5*5=100. Therefore, the number with at least one 4 or 5 is 294-100=194.\n\nNow, let's add up the counts from 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers:\n\n1-digit: 2\n\n2-digit: 22\n\n3-digit: 194\n\nTotal so far: 2+22=24; 24+194=218.\n\nNow, we have to include the number 343, which is 1000_7. Does 1000_7 have a 4 or 5? No, it's 1 followed by three 0s. So it doesn't contribute to the count. Therefore, the total number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 218.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\n1-digit numbers: digits 1-6. Numbers with 4 or 5: 4 and 5, so 2. Correct.\n\n2-digit numbers: total 6*7=42. Without 4 or 5: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5=20. So with 4 or 5: 42-20=22. Correct.\n\n3-digit numbers: total 6*7*7=294. Without 4 or 5: first digit 4 choices, second and third digits 5 choices each. So 4*5*5=100. So with 4 or 5: 294-100=194. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 2+22=24; 24+194=218. Plus 1000_7, which doesn't add anything. So total is 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers.\" So 1 to 343 in decimal. Now, in base 7, 343 is 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number. So when considering 3-digit numbers, we go up to 666_7, which is 342 decimal. So the 343 numbers include all 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit base 7 numbers, plus 1000_7.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I considered 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit numbers and then added 1000_7, but 1000_7 doesn't contribute, so the total was 218.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way is to model all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7 (which are 0 to 342 decimal), and then add 1000_7 (343 decimal). But since 000_7 isn't positive, the numbers from 1 to 343 decimal correspond to 001_7 to 1000_7 in base 7.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, allowing leading zeros, and then include 1000_7 as a separate case. So, in this case, the 343 numbers would be from 001_7 to 666_7 and 1000_7. Wait, but 001_7 is 1, 002_7 is 2, etc., up to 666_7 which is 342, and then 1000_7 is 343. So total is 343 numbers.\n\nSo, if I model each number as a 3-digit number with leading zeros, from 000_7 (0) to 666_7 (342), and then 1000_7 (343). But since 000_7 isn't positive, the positive numbers are from 001_7 to 666_7, which are 342 numbers, and then 1000_7 is the 343rd.\n\nBut in this approach, considering each number as a 3-digit number, including leading zeros, then the total numbers to consider are 343, which includes 001_7 to 666_7 and 1000_7. Wait, but 1000_7 is a 4-digit number, so perhaps it's better to separate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think of all numbers as 3-digit base 7 numbers, from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers (including 000_7), and then exclude 000_7 because we're only considering positive integers, so we have 342 numbers, and then include 1000_7 as the 343rd. Hmm, but this might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct. Let me try again.\n\nTotal numbers: 343 (1 to 343 decimal).\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5: For each digit, the number of choices is 5 (digits 0,1,2,3,6). But we have to consider the number of digits in each number.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which are 343 numbers, including 000_7. Then, the number of numbers without any 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125 (since each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6). But 000_7 is included in this count, which isn't a positive integer. So, the number of positive integers without any 4 or 5 is 125 - 1 = 124 (subtracting 000_7). Therefore, the number of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 124 = 219.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated 218. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers separately:\n\n1-digit: 6 numbers, 2 with 4 or 5.\n\n2-digit: 6*7=42 numbers, 22 with 4 or 5.\n\n3-digit: 6*7*7=294 numbers, 194 with 4 or 5.\n\nTotal: 2+22+194=218.\n\nPlus, 1000_7, which doesn't add anything, so total 218.\n\nIn the second approach, considering all 3-digit numbers with leading zeros (from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers), the number without any 4 or 5 is 5^3=125, including 000_7. So, the number of positive integers without any 4 or 5 is 125 -1=124. Therefore, the number with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 -124=219.\n\nBut wait, why the discrepancy? Which approach is correct?\n\nI think the second approach might be overcounting because when considering numbers with leading zeros, 001_7 is 1, but in reality, 1 is a 1-digit number, not a 3-digit number. So, perhaps the second approach is treating all numbers as 3-digit, which might not be appropriate because the leading zeros aren't actually part of the number. So, maybe the correct way is to model numbers as having variable lengths, from 1 to 3 digits, and then handle 1000_7 separately.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers:\n\n1-digit: 6 numbers, 2 with 4 or 5.\n\n2-digit: 6*7=42 numbers, 22 with 4 or 5.\n\n3-digit: 6*7*7=294 numbers, 194 with 4 or 5.\n\nTotal: 2+22+194=218.\n\nPlus, 1000_7, which doesn't add anything, so total 218.\n\nIn the second approach, considering all numbers as 3-digit with leading zeros, 343 numbers, 125 without 4 or 5, so 343-125=218. But wait, 343-125=218? Wait, 343-125 is 218, not 219. Wait, did I miscalculate earlier?\n\nWait, no, 343-125=218. So in the second approach, if I include 000_7, which is 0, then the positive integers would be 343-1=342 numbers. So, the number without 4 or 5 is 125, but 000_7 is included in that 125. So the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 is 125-1=124. Therefore, the number with at least one 4 or 5 is 342-124=218. Then, including 1000_7, which doesn't add anything, so total is 218.\n\nWait, so both approaches give 218. I think earlier I might have miscalculated the second approach. Let me verify:\n\nIn the second approach:\n\nTotal numbers from 000_7 to 666_7: 343 numbers.\n\nNumber of numbers without 4 or 5: 5^3=125 (each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6).\n\nBut these 125 include 000_7, which isn't a positive integer. So, the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 is 125-1=124.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343-125=218 (since 343 total, minus 125 without 4 or 5). Wait, but 343-125=218. But the positive integers are 1 to 343, which is 343 numbers, but 000_7 isn't included. So, in this case, the number without 4 or 5 is 125, but since 000_7 isn't positive, the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 is 125-1=124. So, the number with at least one 4 or 5 is 343-124=219. Wait, now I'm confused again.\n\nWait, no, if total numbers from 000_7 to 666_7 is 343, which includes 000_7. So, the positive integers are 343-1=342 numbers (from 001_7 to 666_7). The number without 4 or 5 is 125 (including 000_7), so the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 is 125-1=124. Therefore, the number with at least one 4 or 5 is 342-124=218. Then, we have 1000_7, which is 343, and it doesn't have any 4 or 5, so the total remains 218.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, both approaches give 218. Therefore, the answer should be 218.\n\nWait, but let me check the first approach again. 1-digit:2, 2-digit:22, 3-digit:194, total 218. Correct.\n\nBut in the second approach, when I thought of all numbers as 3-digit with leading zeros, I thought 343-125=218, but I had to subtract 1 for 000_7, so 342-124=2",
    "full_cot": "Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit?

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. First, base 7 numbers. Base 7 digits go from 0 to 6, right? So each digit in a base 7 number can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

That makes sense because in base 7, the numbers go from 1 up to 666_7, which is 342 in decimal. Wait, no, hold on. 666 in base 7 is 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342. So the 343rd number would be 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal. But the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so that would be from 1 to 343 in decimal.

So, count is 2.\n\nNow, for 2-digit numbers: in base 7, 2-digit numbers go from 10_7 (which is 7 decimal) to 66_7 (which is 48 decimal). So, how many 2-digit base 7 numbers have at least one 4 or 5? Again, using complementary counting, total 2-digit numbers in base 7: the first digit can be 1-6 (since leading zero isn't allowed), and the second digit can be 0-6. So total 6*7=42 numbers. Now, the number of 2-digit numbers without 4 or 5: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (so 4 choices), and second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5=20 numbers without 4 or 5.

So 4*5=20 without 4 or 5, so 42-20=22 with at least one 4 or 5. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for 3-digit numbers: in base 7, 3-digit numbers go from 100_7 (49 decimal) to 666_7 (342 decimal). The total number of 3-digit numbers in base 7 is 6*7*7=294. Now, how many of these have no 4 or 5? So, first digit: 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit: 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices), third digit: same as second digit, 5 choices. So total without 4 or 5 is 4*5*5=100. Therefore, the number with at least one 4 or 5 is 294-100=194.\n\nNow, let's add up the counts from 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers:\n\n1-digit: 2\n\n2-digit: 22\n\n3-digit: 194\n\nTotal so far: 2+22=24; 24+194=218.\n\nNow, we have to include the number 343, which is 1000_7. Does 1000_7 have a 4 or 5? No, it's 1 followed by three 0s. So it doesn't contribute to the count. Therefore, the total number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 218.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\n1-digit numbers: digits 1-6. Numbers with 4 or 5: 4 and 5, so 2. Correct.\n\n2-digit numbers: total 6*7=42. Without 4 or 5: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So 4*5=20. So with 4 or 5: 42-20=22. Correct.\n\n3-digit numbers: total 6*7*7=294. Without 4 or 5: first digit 4 choices, second and third digits 5 choices each. So 4*5*5=100. So with 4 or 5: 294-100=194.

So when considering 3-digit numbers, we go up to 666_7, which is 342 decimal. So the 343 numbers include all 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit base 7 numbers, plus 1000_7.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I considered 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit numbers and then added 1000_7, but 1000_7 doesn't contribute, so the total was 218.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way is to model all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7 (which are 0 to 342 decimal), and then add 1000_7 (343 decimal). But since 000_7 isn't positive, the numbers from 1 to 343 decimal correspond to 001_7 to 1000_7 in base 7.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, allowing leading zeros, and then include 1000_7 as a separate case. So, in this case, the 343 numbers would be from 001_7 to 666_7 and 1000_7. Wait, but 001_7 is 1, 002_7 is 2, etc., up to 666_7 which is 342, and then 1000_7 is 343. So total is 343 numbers.\n\nSo, if I model each number as a 3-digit number with leading zeros, from 000_7 (0) to 666_7 (342), and then 1000_7 (343). But since 000_7 isn't positive, the positive numbers are from 001_7 to 666_7, which are 342 numbers, and then 1000_7 is the 343rd.\n\nBut in this approach, considering each number as a 3-digit number, including leading zeros, then the total numbers to consider are 343, which includes 001_7 to 666_7 and 1000_7. Wait, but 1000_7 is a 4-digit number, so perhaps it's better to separate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think of all numbers as 3-digit base 7 numbers, from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers (including 000_7), and then exclude 000_7 because we're only considering positive integers, so we have 342 numbers, and then include 1000_7 as the 343rd. Hmm, but this might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct. Let me try again.\n\nTotal numbers: 343 (1 to 343 decimal).\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5: For each digit, the number of choices is 5 (digits 0,1,2,3,6). But we have to consider the number of digits in each number.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model all numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which are 343 numbers, including 000_7. Then, the number of numbers without any 4 or 5 is 5^3 = 125 (since each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6). But 000_7 is included in this count, which isn't a positive integer. So, the number of positive integers without any 4 or 5 is 125 - 1 = 124 (subtracting 000_7). Therefore, the number of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 124 = 219.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated 218. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers separately:\n\n1-digit: 6 numbers, 2 with 4 or 5.\n\n2-digit: 6*7=42 numbers, 22 with 4 or 5.\n\n3-digit: 6*7*7=294 numbers, 194 with 4 or 5.\n\nTotal: 2+22+194=218.\n\nPlus, 1000_7, which doesn't add anything, so total 218.\n\nIn the second approach, considering all 3-digit numbers with leading zeros (from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers), the number without any 4 or 5 is 5^3=125, including 000_7. So, the number of positive integers without any 4 or 5 is 125 -1=124. Therefore, the number with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 -124=219.\n\nBut wait, why the discrepancy? Which approach is correct?\n\nI think the second approach might be overcounting because when considering numbers with leading zeros, 001_7 is 1, but in reality, 1 is a 1-digit number, not a 3-digit number. So, perhaps the second approach is treating all numbers as 3-digit, which might not be appropriate because the leading zeros aren't actually part of the number. So, maybe the correct way is to model numbers as having variable lengths, from 1 to 3 digits, and then handle 1000_7 separately.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers:\n\n1-digit: 6 numbers, 2 with 4 or 5.\n\n2-digit: 6*7=42 numbers, 22 with 4 or 5.\n\n3-digit: 6*7*7=294 numbers, 194 with 4 or 5.\n\nTotal: 2+22+194=218.\n\nPlus, 1000_7, which doesn't add anything, so total 218.\n\nIn the second approach, considering all numbers as 3-digit with leading zeros, 343 numbers, 125 without 4 or 5, so 343-125=218. But wait, 343-125=218? Wait, 343-125 is 218, not 219. Wait, did I miscalculate earlier?\n\nWait, no, 343-125=218. So in the second approach, if I include 000_7, which is 0, then the positive integers would be 343-1=342 numbers. So, the number without 4 or 5 is 125, but 000_7 is included in that 125. So the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 is 125-1=124. Therefore, the number with at least one 4 or 5 is 342-124=218. Then, including 1000_7, which doesn't add anything, so total is 218.\n\nWait, so both approaches give 218. I think earlier I might have miscalculated the second approach. Let me verify:\n\nIn the second approach:\n\nTotal numbers from 000_7 to 666_7: 343 numbers.\n\nNumber of numbers without 4 or 5: 5^3=125 (each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6).\n\nBut these 125 include 000_7, which isn't a positive integer. So, the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 is 125-1=124.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343-125=218 (since 343 total, minus 125 without 4 or 5). Wait, but 343-125=218. But the positive integers are 1 to 343, which is 343 numbers, but 000_7 isn't included. So, in this case, the number without 4 or 5 is 125, but since 000_7 isn't positive, the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 is 125-1=124. So, the number with at least one 4 or 5 is 343-124=219. Wait, now I'm confused again.\n\nWait, no, if total numbers from 000_7 to 666_7 is 343, which includes 000_7. So, the positive integers are 343-1=342 numbers (from 001_7 to 666_7). The number without 4 or 5 is 125 (including 000_7), so the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 is 125-1=124. Therefore, the number with at least one 4 or 5 is 342-124=218. Then, we have 1000_7, which is 343, and it doesn't have any 4 or 5, so the total remains 218.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, both approaches give 218. Therefore, the answer should be 218.\n\nWait, but let me check the first approach again. 1-digit:2, 2-digit:22, 3-digit:194, total 218. Correct.\n\nBut in the second approach, when I thought of all numbers as 3-digit with leading zeros, I thought 343-125=218, but I had to subtract 1 for 000_7, so 342-124=2",

The problem is asking about numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 in any of their digits. And we're considering the 343 smallest positive integers. Wait, 343... that's 7 cubed, right? So 7^3 = 343. That makes sense because in base 7, the numbers go from 1 up to 666_7, which is 342 in decimal. Wait, no, hold on.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Actually, 666_7 is 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342.",

So the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be from 1 up to 666_7, which is 342, but wait, that's 342 numbers. So maybe the 343rd number is 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal. So the numbers we're considering are from 1 up to 1000_7 - 1, which is 666_7. So 342 numbers in total. Hmm, but the problem says 343 smallest positive integers. Wait, maybe including 343 itself, which is 1000_7. So the numbers are from 1 to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers. So that's 1 to 666_7 and then 1000_7. So 343 numbers in total. So we need to find how many of these 343 numbers have at least one 4 or 5 in their base 7 representation.\n\nOkay, so perhaps the best way to approach this is using complementary counting. Instead of counting the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5, I can count the total numbers and subtract those that have no 4s and no 5s. That should give me the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nSo first, let's figure out how many digits these numbers have in base 7. The number 343 is 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number. So the numbers from 1 to 666_7 are 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit numbers in base 7. And 1000_7 is a 4-digit number. So in total, we have 4-digit numbers as well.\n\nWait, but in base 7, the number of digits for numbers up to 343 would be 1 to 4 digits. So we need to consider numbers with 1, 2, 3, and 4 digits in base 7.\n\nBut wait, the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be from 1 (which is 1_7) up to 1000_7 (which is 343 in decimal). So 1000_7 is included, making it 343 numbers.\n\nSo to count how many of these numbers have at least one 4 or 5, we can compute the total numbers (343) minus the numbers that have no 4s and no 5s in any digit.\n\nSo, let's compute the number of numbers that have no 4s and no 5s. That means each digit can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 6. Wait, but in base 7, the digits go from 0 to 6, so excluding 4 and 5, we have 5 choices per digit: 0,1,2,3,6.\n\nBut wait, for numbers with leading zeros? No, because we are considering numbers from 1 to 1000_7, which includes numbers with 1, 2, 3, and 4 digits. So we need to count numbers with 1, 2, 3, and 4 digits in base 7, excluding those that have 4 or 5 in any digit.\n\nWait, but for 1-digit numbers, the digits can't be 0, because we're considering positive integers. So 1-digit numbers without 4 or 5: digits can be 1,2,3,6. So 4 options.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: the first digit (the 7's place) can't be 0, so it can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), and the second digit (the units place) can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So 4*5 = 20 numbers.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: the first digit (49's place) can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), the second digit (7's place) can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options), and the third digit (units place) can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So 4*5*5 = 100 numbers.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: in base 7, the 4-digit numbers up to 1000_7 are just 1000_7 itself, which is 343 in decimal. So 1000_7 is the only 4-digit number in our range. So we need to check if 1000_7 has any 4 or 5. It's 1 followed by three 0s, so no 4 or 5. So it's included in the count of numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but does 1000_7 have digits other than 1 and 0? Yes, it's 1 followed by three 0s, so it's allowed. So for 4-digit numbers, only 1 number, which is 1000_7, and it doesn't have any 4 or 5.\n\nSo the total number of numbers without any 4 or 5 is:\n\n1-digit: 4\n\n2-digit: 20\n\n3-digit: 100\n\n4-digit: 1\n\nTotal: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So 1-digit numbers: 1,2,3,6. That's 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second digit 5 options, so 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit 4, second digit 5, third digit 5, so 4*5*5=100.\n\n4-digit numbers: only 1000_7, which is allowed, so 1.\n\nTotal: 4+20=24, 24+100=124, 124+1=125. So 125 numbers without any 4 or 5.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is total numbers (343) minus 125, which is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did this correctly. So 343 total numbers, 125 without any 4 or 5, so 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, in the 4-digit numbers, is 1000_7 the only number? Yes, because 1000_7 is 343, and the next number would be 1001_7, which is 344, but we're only considering up to 343. So yes, only 1000_7 is the 4-digit number in our range.\n\nWait, but another thing: when considering numbers without any 4 or 5, for 3-digit numbers, are we including leading zeros? No, because in base 7, numbers don't have leading zeros. So for example, the number 010_7 is actually 10_7, which is a 2-digit number. So our count for 3-digit numbers is correct as 4*5*5=100, because the first digit can't be zero.\n\nSimilarly, for 2-digit numbers, the first digit can't be zero, so 4 options, and the second digit can be zero, so 5 options, making 20.\n\nAnd for 1-digit numbers, 4 options, as zero isn't considered a positive integer.\n\nSo total without 4 or 5 is 4 + 20 + 100 +1=125.\n\nTherefore, the numbers with at least one 4 or 5 are 343 -125=218.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 343 numbers include from 1 to 343, which is 343 numbers. But in base 7, 343 is 1000_7, so that's included.\n\nBut let me check: when counting numbers without 4 or 5, did I include 1000_7? Yes, because it's allowed, and it's the only 4-digit number, so it's included in the count.\n\nSo 343 total, 125 without, so 218 with at least one 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check the count again.\n\nFor 1-digit numbers: 1,2,3,6. That's 4 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So 4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 options each. So 4*5*5=100.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: only 1000_7, which is allowed, so 1.\n\nTotal without 4 or 5: 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo 343 -125=218.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nBut I think the way I did it is correct. So the answer should be 218.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the count of numbers without 4 or 5 is correct.\n\nAnother way: for each digit position, count the number of allowed digits, and multiply them.\n\nBut we have numbers with 1,2,3,4 digits.\n\nWait, but for numbers with n digits in base 7, the first digit can't be zero, so for each n, the number of allowed numbers without 4 or 5 is:\n\nFor n=1: 4 options (1,2,3,6)\n\nFor n=2: 4 (first digit) *5 (second digit)=20\n\nFor n=3:4*5*5=100\n\nFor n=4: only 1000_7, which is allowed, so 1.\n\nSo total is 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is 343 -125=218.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem asks how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 (or both). \n\nTo solve this, we use complementary counting. We first determine the total number of integers (343) and then subtract the count of numbers that do not contain 4 or 5 in any digit.\n\n1. **Total Numbers**: The 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 range from 1 to 1000_7 (which is 343 in decimal).\n\n2. **Count Without 4 or 5**:\n   - **1-digit numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 6 \u2192 4 numbers.\n   - **2-digit numbers**: First digit (1,2,3,6) and second digit (0,1,2,3,6) \u2192 4\u00d75 = 20 numbers.\n   - **3-digit numbers**: First digit (1,2,3,6), second and third digits (0,1,2,3,6) \u2192 4\u00d75\u00d75 = 100 numbers.\n   - **4-digit number**: Only 1000_7 \u2192 1 number.\n\n   Total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\n3. **Numbers with 4 or 5**: 343 total - 125 without = 218 numbers.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{218}",

Problem: How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 or both. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. First, base 7 numbers. Base 7 digits go from 0 to 6, right? So each digit in a base 7 number can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The problem is asking about numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 in any of their digits. And we're considering the 343 smallest positive integers. Wait, 343... that's 7 cubed, right? So 7^3 = 343. That makes sense because in base 7, the numbers go from 1 up to 666_7, which is 342 in decimal. Wait, no, hold on. Actually, 666_7 is 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342. So the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be from 1 up to 666_7, which is 342, but wait, that's 342 numbers. So maybe the 343rd number is 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal. So the numbers we're considering are from 1 up to 1000_7 - 1, which is 666_7. So 342 numbers in total. Hmm, but the problem says 343 smallest positive integers. Wait, maybe including 343 itself, which is 1000_7. So the numbers are from 1 to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers. So that's 1 to 666_7 and then 1000_7. So 343 numbers in total. So we need to find how many of these 343 numbers have at least one 4 or 5 in their base 7 representation.\n\nOkay, so perhaps the best way to approach this is using complementary counting. Instead of counting the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5, I can count the total numbers and subtract those that have no 4s and no 5s. That should give me the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nSo first, let's figure out how many digits these numbers have in base 7. The number 343 is 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number. So the numbers from 1 to 666_7 are 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit numbers in base 7. And 1000_7 is a 4-digit number. So in total, we have 4-digit numbers as well.\n\nWait, but in base 7, the number of digits for numbers up to 343 would be 1 to 4 digits. So we need to consider numbers with 1, 2, 3, and 4 digits in base 7.\n\nBut wait, the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be from 1 (which is 1_7) up to 1000_7 (which is 343 in decimal). So 1000_7 is included, making it 343 numbers.\n\nSo to count how many of these numbers have at least one 4 or 5, we can compute the total numbers (343) minus the numbers that have no 4s and no 5s in any digit.\n\nSo, let's compute the number of numbers that have no 4s and no 5s. That means each digit can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 6. Wait, but in base 7, the digits go from 0 to 6, so excluding 4 and 5, we have 5 choices per digit: 0,1,2,3,6.\n\nBut wait, for numbers with leading zeros? No, because we are considering numbers from 1 to 1000_7, which includes numbers with 1, 2, 3, and 4 digits. So we need to count numbers with 1, 2, 3, and 4 digits in base 7, excluding those that have 4 or 5 in any digit.\n\nWait, but for 1-digit numbers, the digits can't be 0, because we're considering positive integers. So 1-digit numbers without 4 or 5: digits can be 1,2,3,6. So 4 options.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: the first digit (the 7's place) can't be 0, so it can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), and the second digit (the units place) can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So 4*5 = 20 numbers.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: the first digit (49's place) can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), the second digit (7's place) can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options), and the third digit (units place) can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So 4*5*5 = 100 numbers.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: in base 7, the 4-digit numbers up to 1000_7 are just 1000_7 itself, which is 343 in decimal. So 1000_7 is the only 4-digit number in our range. So we need to check if 1000_7 has any 4 or 5. It's 1 followed by three 0s, so no 4 or 5. So it's included in the count of numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but does 1000_7 have digits other than 1 and 0? Yes, it's 1 followed by three 0s, so it's allowed. So for 4-digit numbers, only 1 number, which is 1000_7, and it doesn't have any 4 or 5.\n\nSo the total number of numbers without any 4 or 5 is:\n\n1-digit: 4\n\n2-digit: 20\n\n3-digit: 100\n\n4-digit: 1\n\nTotal: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So 1-digit numbers: 1,2,3,6. That's 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second digit 5 options, so 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit 4, second digit 5, third digit 5, so 4*5*5=100.\n\n4-digit numbers: only 1000_7, which is allowed, so 1.\n\nTotal: 4+20=24, 24+100=124, 124+1=125. So 125 numbers without any 4 or 5.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is total numbers (343) minus 125, which is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did this correctly. So 343 total numbers, 125 without any 4 or 5, so 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, in the 4-digit numbers, is 1000_7 the only number? Yes, because 1000_7 is 343, and the next number would be 1001_7, which is 344, but we're only considering up to 343. So yes, only 1000_7 is the 4-digit number in our range.\n\nWait, but another thing: when considering numbers without any 4 or 5, for 3-digit numbers, are we including leading zeros? No, because in base 7, numbers don't have leading zeros. So for example, the number 010_7 is actually 10_7, which is a 2-digit number. So our count for 3-digit numbers is correct as 4*5*5=100, because the first digit can't be zero.\n\nSimilarly, for 2-digit numbers, the first digit can't be zero, so 4 options, and the second digit can be zero, so 5 options, making 20.\n\nAnd for 1-digit numbers, 4 options, as zero isn't considered a positive integer.\n\nSo total without 4 or 5 is 4 + 20 + 100 +1=125.\n\nTherefore, the numbers with at least one 4 or 5 are 343 -125=218.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 343 numbers include from 1 to 343, which is 343 numbers. But in base 7, 343 is 1000_7, so that's included.\n\nBut let me check: when counting numbers without 4 or 5, did I include 1000_7? Yes, because it's allowed, and it's the only 4-digit number, so it's included in the count.\n\nSo 343 total, 125 without, so 218 with at least one 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check the count again.\n\nFor 1-digit numbers: 1,2,3,6. That's 4 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So 4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 options each. So 4*5*5=100.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: only 1000_7, which is allowed, so 1.\n\nTotal without 4 or 5: 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo 343 -125=218.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nBut I think the way I did it is correct. So the answer should be 218.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the count of numbers without 4 or 5 is correct.\n\nAnother way: for each digit position, count the number of allowed digits, and multiply them.\n\nBut we have numbers with 1,2,3,4 digits.\n\nWait, but for numbers with n digits in base 7, the first digit can't be zero, so for each n, the number of allowed numbers without 4 or 5 is:\n\nFor n=1: 4 options (1,2,3,6)\n\nFor n=2: 4 (first digit) *5 (second digit)=20\n\nFor n=3:4*5*5=100\n\nFor n=4: only 1000_7, which is allowed, so 1.\n\nSo total is 4+20+100+1=125.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is 343 -125=218.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem asks how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 (or both). \n\nTo solve this, we use complementary counting. We first determine the total number of integers (343) and then subtract the count of numbers that do not contain 4 or 5 in any digit.\n\n1. **Total Numbers**: The 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 range from 1 to 1000_7 (which is 343 in decimal).\n\n2. **Count Without 4 or 5**:\n   - **1-digit numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 6 \u2192 4 numbers.\n   - **2-digit numbers**: First digit (1,2,3,6) and second digit (0,1,2,3,6) \u2192 4\u00d75 = 20 numbers.\n   - **3-digit numbers**: First digit (1,2,3,6), second and third digits (0,1,2,3,6) \u2192 4\u00d75\u00d75 = 100 numbers.\n   - **4-digit number**: Only 1000_7 \u2192 1 number.\n\n   Total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\n3. **Numbers with 4 or 5**: 343 total - 125 without = 218 numbers.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{218}",

Hmm, maybe I need to check that again.\n\nWait, 343 in base 10 is equal to 1000_7, right? Because 7^3 = 343. So the number 343 in base 10 is 1000_7. So the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be from 1 up to 666_7, which is 342, but then 1000_7 is 343, so maybe the numbers go up to 1000_7, which is 343.

So perhaps the numbers to consider are from 1_7 to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers, and we need to find how many of these have at least one 4 or 5 in their digits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model the problem as numbers with up to 3 digits in base 7, i.e., numbers from 1 to 666_7 (which is 342 in decimal), and then the 343rd number is 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let me just proceed with the assumption that we're dealing with numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, which in base 7 range from 1_7 up to 1000_7. So each number can be represented as a 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, or 4-digit number in base 7.

Then, since the problem is about positive integers, we can exclude 000_7, so 342 numbers. But the problem says 343, so perhaps it's including 000_7. Hmm, but 000_7 is zero, which is not positive. So maybe the problem is considering numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then we can calculate how many of those have at least one 4 or 5, and then if we need to adjust for zero, but perhaps the problem is okay with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply considering numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, which in base 7 go up to 1000_7, but that's a 4-digit number. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me try to model the problem as follows: The 343 smallest positive integers in base 7. Since 343 is 7^3, the numbers go from 1 up to 666_7, which is 342 in decimal, and then 1000_7 is 343. So perhaps the 343 numbers include 1 to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers, but 1000_7 is a 4-digit number. So perhaps it's better to model each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, allowing leading zeros, so that each number from 000_7 to 666_7 corresponds to 0 to 342 in decimal, and then 1000_7 is 343. So perhaps the problem is considering numbers from 1 to 666_7 (342 numbers) and 1000_7 (343), but that complicates things because 1000_7 is a 4-digit number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just considering all 3-digit base 7 numbers, including leading zeros, so from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then since we're only interested in positive integers, we can exclude 000_7, leaving 342 numbers. But the problem says 343, so perhaps it's including 000_7, but since it's zero, maybe it's not counted. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking about all numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, written in base 7, and how many of those have at least one 4 or 5 in their digits. So that would include numbers from 1_7 to 1000_7. So each number can be represented as up to 4 digits in base 7. So perhaps I should model each number as a 4-digit base 7 number with leading zeros, so from 0001_7 to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model each number as a 3-digit base 7 number, allowing leading zeros, so that each number from 000_7 to 666_7 corresponds to 0 to 342 in decimal, and then 1000_7 is 343. So perhaps the problem is considering numbers up to 3 digits, i.e., from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and we can include 000_7, and then subtract it if necessary.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"smallest positive integers,\" so 1 to 343 in decimal. So in base 7, that's from 1_7 to 1000_7, which includes numbers with 1, 2, 3, and 4 digits. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe I should consider each number as a 3-digit base 7 number, with leading zeros, so that each number is represented as ABC_7, where A, B, C are digits from 0 to 6, and then count how many of these have at least one 4 or 5 in A, B, or C. But since we're considering positive integers, we might have to adjust for leading zeros.\n\nWait, but if we model each number as a 3-digit base 7 number, including leading zeros, then 000_7 is 0, which is not positive, so we can exclude it. So the numbers from 001_7 to 666_7 correspond to 1 to 342 in decimal, and then 1000_7 is 343. So perhaps the problem is considering numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, which in base 7 are from 1_7 to 1000_7. So maybe it's better to model each number as a 4-digit base 7 number, with the first digit being 0 or 1, since 343 is 1000_7.\n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to calculate the total number of 3-digit base 7 numbers (including leading zeros) that have at least one 4 or 5, and then adjust for the 4-digit number 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal. So let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's model each number as a 3-digit base 7 number with leading zeros, so from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers. Now, since we're dealing with positive integers, we can exclude 000_7, so we have 342 numbers. But the problem says 343, so perhaps it's including 000_7, but that's zero, which is not positive. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just considering all 3-digit base 7 numbers, including leading zeros, so 343 numbers, and we can proceed to calculate how many of these have at least one 4 or 5. Then, if necessary, we can adjust for the fact that 000_7 is zero, but perhaps the problem is okay with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model each number as a 3-digit base 7 number without leading zeros, so that each number is from 1_7 to 666_7, which is 342 numbers, and then the 343rd number is 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal. So perhaps we can calculate the count for the 3-digit numbers and then check the 4-digit number separately.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract the count of numbers that don't have any 4 or 5, which would give us the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5. So total numbers = 343, numbers without any 4 or 5 = ?\n\nWait, that's a standard combinatorial approach: total minus the ones that don't meet the criteria.\n\nSo, total numbers: 343.\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5: each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. So for each digit, 5 choices. Since we're considering 3-digit numbers with leading zeros, each of the three digits can be 0,1,2,3,6, so 5 options each. So total numbers without any 4 or 5: 5^3 = 125.\n\nBut wait, this includes 000_7, which is zero. So if we're only considering positive integers, we need to subtract 1 to exclude 000_7. So numbers without any 4 or 5 and positive: 125 - 1 = 124.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"smallest positive integers,\" so maybe we're including 1 to 343 in decimal, which in base 7 includes 1000_7. So perhaps we need to include that as well.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to structure it more clearly.\n\nApproach 1: Consider all 3-digit base 7 numbers, including leading zeros, so 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers. Then, calculate how many of these have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nTotal numbers: 343.\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5: For each digit, possible digits are 0,1,2,3,6. So 5 choices per digit. So total without any 4 or 5: 5^3 = 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut wait, if we're considering positive integers, 000_7 is zero, which is not positive. So in the total, we have 343 numbers, but only 342 are positive. So the count without any 4 or 5 is 125, which includes 000_7. So the count of positive numbers without any 4 or 5 is 125 - 1 = 124.\n\nTherefore, positive numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 342 - 124 = 218.\n\nBut the problem says 343 smallest positive integers, so perhaps including 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal, which is a 4-digit number in base 7. So we need to check if 1000_7 has a 4 or 5. 1000_7 is '1', '0', '0', '0', so no 4 or 5. So if we include 1000_7, which is 343, then our total numbers would be 343, and the count without any 4 or 5 would be 125 (including 000_7) plus 1 (1000_7), which is 126. Therefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5 would be 343 - 126 = 217.\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, if we consider numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then 1000_7 is the next number, which is 343 in decimal. So if we include 1000_7 as the 343rd number, then the total numbers we're considering are 344, which is not correct. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think that the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 are from 1_7 to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers. So that includes all 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and the first 4-digit number in base 7. So in this case, we have 343 numbers, and we need to find how many of these have at least one 4 or 5 in their digits.\n\nSo, total numbers: 343.\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5: For 1-digit numbers, digits are 1 to 6. So digits without 4 or 5: 1,2,3,6. So 4 options.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: The first digit can be 1-6, but without 4 or 5, so 4 options. The second digit can be 0-6, without 4 or 5, so 5 options. So 4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: Each digit can be 0-6, without 4 or 5, so first digit (hundreds place): 4 options (1,2,3,6), second and third digits: 5 options each (0,1,2,3,6). So 4*5*5=100.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: Only 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal. The digits are 1,0,0,0, so no 4 or 5. So 1 number without 4 or 5.\n\nSo total numbers without any 4 or 5: 4 (1-digit) + 20 (2-digit) + 100 (3-digit) + 1 (4-digit) = 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 total - 125 without = 218.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 1000_7 doesn't have any 4 or 5, so it's included in the count of numbers without 4 or 5. So total numbers without 4 or 5 is 125, so numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut wait, when I considered 3-digit numbers with leading zeros, I had 5^3 = 125 numbers without 4 or 5, which includes 000_7, but since we're considering positive integers, maybe it's better to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- 1-digit numbers: 1-6 in base 7, which is 1-6 in decimal. Numbers without 4 or 5: 1,2,3,6 \u2192 4 numbers.\n\n- 2-digit numbers: from 10_7 (7) to 66_7 (48).",

But perhaps for simplicity, we can model each number as a 3-digit number in base 7 by allowing leading zeros, so that each number is represented as a 3-digit number from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then exclude 000_7 because we're only considering positive integers. So that would give us 342 numbers. But the problem says 343, so maybe we need to include 000_7 as well, but since it's not positive, maybe it's better to consider numbers from 001_7 to 666_7, which is 342 numbers, and then perhaps the 343rd number is 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal. Hmm, maybe the problem is just considering numbers up to 3 digits, so 343 numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, and we can include 000_7 for calculation purposes, and then subtract it if necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as all 3-digit numbers in base 7, including leading zeros, so 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers. Then, since the problem is about positive integers, we can exclude 000_7, so 342 numbers. But the problem says 343, so perhaps it's including 000_7. Hmm, but 000_7 is zero, which is not positive. So maybe the problem is considering numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then we can calculate how many of those have at least one 4 or 5, and then if we need to adjust for zero, but perhaps the problem is okay with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply considering numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, which in base 7 go up to 1000_7, but that's a 4-digit number. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me try to model the problem as follows: The 343 smallest positive integers in base 7. Since 343 is 7^3, the numbers go from 1 up to 666_7, which is 342 in decimal, and then 1000_7 is 343. So perhaps the 343 numbers include 1 to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers, but 1000_7 is a 4-digit number. So perhaps it's better to model each number as a 3-digit number in base 7, allowing leading zeros, so that each number from 000_7 to 666_7 corresponds to 0 to 342 in decimal, and then 1000_7 is 343. So perhaps the problem is considering numbers from 1 to 666_7 (342 numbers) and 1000_7 (343), but that complicates things because 1000_7 is a 4-digit number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just considering all 3-digit base 7 numbers, including leading zeros, so from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then since we're only interested in positive integers, we can exclude 000_7, leaving 342 numbers. But the problem says 343, so perhaps it's including 000_7, but since it's zero, maybe it's not counted. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking about all numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, written in base 7, and how many of those have at least one 4 or 5 in their digits. So that would include numbers from 1_7 to 1000_7. So each number can be represented as up to 4 digits in base 7. So perhaps I should model each number as a 4-digit base 7 number with leading zeros, so from 0001_7 to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model each number as a 3-digit base 7 number, allowing leading zeros, so that each number from 000_7 to 666_7 corresponds to 0 to 342 in decimal, and then 1000_7 is 343. So perhaps the problem is considering numbers up to 3 digits, i.e., from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and we can include 000_7, and then subtract it if necessary.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"smallest positive integers,\" so 1 to 343 in decimal. So in base 7, that's from 1_7 to 1000_7, which includes numbers with 1, 2, 3, and 4 digits. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe I should consider each number as a 3-digit base 7 number, with leading zeros, so that each number is represented as ABC_7, where A, B, C are digits from 0 to 6, and then count how many of these have at least one 4 or 5 in A, B, or C. But since we're considering positive integers, we might have to adjust for leading zeros.\n\nWait, but if we model each number as a 3-digit base 7 number, including leading zeros, then 000_7 is 0, which is not positive, so we can exclude it. So the numbers from 001_7 to 666_7 correspond to 1 to 342 in decimal, and then 1000_7 is 343. So perhaps the problem is considering numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, which in base 7 are from 1_7 to 1000_7. So maybe it's better to model each number as a 4-digit base 7 number, with the first digit being 0 or 1, since 343 is 1000_7.\n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to calculate the total number of 3-digit base 7 numbers (including leading zeros) that have at least one 4 or 5, and then adjust for the 4-digit number 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal. So let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's model each number as a 3-digit base 7 number with leading zeros, so from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers. Now, since we're dealing with positive integers, we can exclude 000_7, so we have 342 numbers. But the problem says 343, so perhaps it's including 000_7, but that's zero, which is not positive. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just considering all 3-digit base 7 numbers, including leading zeros, so 343 numbers, and we can proceed to calculate how many of these have at least one 4 or 5. Then, if necessary, we can adjust for the fact that 000_7 is zero, but perhaps the problem is okay with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model each number as a 3-digit base 7 number without leading zeros, so that each number is from 1_7 to 666_7, which is 342 numbers, and then the 343rd number is 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal. So perhaps we can calculate the count for the 3-digit numbers and then check the 4-digit number separately.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract the count of numbers that don't have any 4 or 5, which would give us the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5. So total numbers = 343, numbers without any 4 or 5 = ?\n\nWait, that's a standard combinatorial approach: total minus the ones that don't meet the criteria.\n\nSo, total numbers: 343.\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5: each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. So for each digit, 5 choices. Since we're considering 3-digit numbers with leading zeros, each of the three digits can be 0,1,2,3,6, so 5 options each. So total numbers without any 4 or 5: 5^3 = 125.\n\nBut wait, this includes 000_7, which is zero. So if we're only considering positive integers, we need to subtract 1 to exclude 000_7. So numbers without any 4 or 5 and positive: 125 - 1 = 124.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"smallest positive integers,\" so maybe we're including 1 to 343 in decimal, which in base 7 includes 1000_7. So perhaps we need to include that as well.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to structure it more clearly.\n\nApproach 1: Consider all 3-digit base 7 numbers, including leading zeros, so 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers. Then, calculate how many of these have at least one 4 or 5.\n\nTotal numbers: 343.\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5: For each digit, possible digits are 0,1,2,3,6. So 5 choices per digit. So total without any 4 or 5: 5^3 = 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut wait, if we're considering positive integers, 000_7 is zero, which is not positive. So in the total, we have 343 numbers, but only 342 are positive. So the count without any 4 or 5 is 125, which includes 000_7. So the count of positive numbers without any 4 or 5 is 125 - 1 = 124.\n\nTherefore, positive numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 342 - 124 = 218.\n\nBut the problem says 343 smallest positive integers, so perhaps including 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal, which is a 4-digit number in base 7. So we need to check if 1000_7 has a 4 or 5. 1000_7 is '1', '0', '0', '0', so no 4 or 5. So if we include 1000_7, which is 343, then our total numbers would be 343, and the count without any 4 or 5 would be 125 (including 000_7) plus 1 (1000_7), which is 126. Therefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5 would be 343 - 126 = 217.\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, if we consider numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then 1000_7 is the next number, which is 343 in decimal. So if we include 1000_7 as the 343rd number, then the total numbers we're considering are 344, which is not correct. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think that the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 are from 1_7 to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers. So that includes all 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and the first 4-digit number in base 7. So in this case, we have 343 numbers, and we need to find how many of these have at least one 4 or 5 in their digits.\n\nSo, total numbers: 343.\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5: For 1-digit numbers, digits are 1 to 6. So digits without 4 or 5: 1,2,3,6. So 4 options.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: The first digit can be 1-6, but without 4 or 5, so 4 options. The second digit can be 0-6, without 4 or 5, so 5 options. So 4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: Each digit can be 0-6, without 4 or 5, so first digit (hundreds place): 4 options (1,2,3,6), second and third digits: 5 options each (0,1,2,3,6). So 4*5*5=100.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: Only 1000_7, which is 343 in decimal. The digits are 1,0,0,0, so no 4 or 5. So 1 number without 4 or 5.\n\nSo total numbers without any 4 or 5: 4 (1-digit) + 20 (2-digit) + 100 (3-digit) + 1 (4-digit) = 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 total - 125 without = 218.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 1000_7 doesn't have any 4 or 5, so it's included in the count of numbers without 4 or 5. So total numbers without 4 or 5 is 125, so numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut wait, when I considered 3-digit numbers with leading zeros, I had 5^3 = 125 numbers without 4 or 5, which includes 000_7, but since we're considering positive integers, maybe it's better to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- 1-digit numbers: 1-6 in base 7, which is 1-6 in decimal. Numbers without 4 or 5: 1,2,3,6 \u2192 4 numbers.\n\n- 2-digit numbers: from 10_7 (7) to 66_7 (48).",

The problem is asking about numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 in any of their digits. And we're considering the 343 smallest positive integers. Wait, 343... that's 7 cubed, right? So 7^3 = 343.

So maybe the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 are the numbers from 1 up to 666_7, which is 342 in decimal. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, 343 in decimal is 1000_7, so the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be from 1_7 (which is 1 in decimal) up to 666_7 (which is 342 in decimal). So 343 numbers, but 666_7 is 342, so does that mean 343 is not included? Wait, 343 is 1000_7, so if we're including up to 343, then we're going up to 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number. So maybe the numbers we're considering are from 1_7 (1) up to 1000_7 (343), but in base 7, that's 1 to 1000_7, which includes 343 numbers. So in base 7, these numbers can have 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits. Hmm, okay.\n\nSo the problem is: how many of these numbers (from 1 to 343 in decimal, which is 1 to 1000_7 in base 7) have at least one digit that is 4 or 5. So, I think the way to approach this is using complementary counting. Instead of counting the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5, I can subtract the numbers that have no 4s or 5s from the total number of numbers. That should give me the count I need.\n\nTotal numbers: 343.\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5: Each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. But wait, in base 7, the digits go from 0 to 6, so if we exclude 4 and 5, the allowed digits are 0,1,2,3,6. That's 5 digits. But we have to be careful because leading zeros aren't allowed. So, for numbers with 1 digit, 2 digits, 3 digits, and 4 digits in base 7, how many have no 4 or 5?\n\nWait, let me think. Let's break it down by the number of digits.\n\nFirst, let's consider how many numbers there are in base 7 with 1 digit, 2 digits, 3 digits, and 4 digits, and then count how many of each have no 4 or 5.\n\n1-digit numbers in base 7: 1 to 6. So 6 numbers. How many of these have no 4 or 5? Well, digits allowed are 1,2,3,6. So that's 4 numbers (1,2,3,6). Wait, but 0 is allowed as a digit, but in 1-digit numbers, 0 isn't considered a positive integer. So yes, 4 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\n2-digit numbers in base 7: The first digit can be 1-6, and the second digit can be 0-6. So total 6*7=42 numbers. Now, how many have no 4 or 5? For the first digit, allowed digits are 1,2,3,6 (4 options). For the second digit, allowed digits are 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So 4*5=20 numbers.\n\n3-digit numbers in base 7: First digit 1-6, second and third digits 0-6. Total 6*7*7=294 numbers. Numbers without 4 or 5: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options), third digit same as second. So 4*5*5=100 numbers.\n\n4-digit numbers in base 7: Only one 4-digit number, which is 1000_7 (343 in decimal). So how many 4-digit numbers are there? Well, 1 to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers. Wait, but 1000_7 is 343, so maybe we're only considering up to 3 digits? Wait, no, because 343 is a 4-digit number in base 7. So, do we include 1000_7? Let me check. The problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which would be 1 to 343. So yes, 1000_7 is included.\n\nSo 4-digit numbers in base 7: only 1000_7. Now, does 1000_7 have a 4 or 5? The digits are 1,0,0,0. So no, it doesn't have 4 or 5. So how many 4-digit numbers have no 4 or 5? Just 1, which is 1000_7.\n\nWait, but is 1000_7 the only 4-digit number? Yes, because 1000_7 is 343, and the next number would be 1001_7, which is 344, but we're only considering up to 343. So, yes, only one 4-digit number, which is 1000_7, and it doesn't have 4 or 5.\n\nSo now, let's add up the numbers without any 4 or 5.\n\n1-digit: 4\n2-digit: 20\n3-digit: 100\n4-digit: 1\nTotal without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. 4+20 is 24, plus 100 is 124, plus 1 is 125. So 125 numbers without any 4 or 5.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 3-digit numbers, first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 each, so 4*5*5=100. That's correct.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers, only 1000_7, which is 1 number. So yes, 125 total.\n\nTherefore, the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 are total numbers (343) minus numbers without 4 or 5 (125). So 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. 343 - 125 is 218? Wait, 343 - 125: 343 - 100 is 243, minus 25 is 218. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut hold on, let me make sure I didn't include 0 in the count. Because in base 7, 0 is not a positive integer, so when I was counting 1-digit numbers, I correctly excluded 0. Similarly, in 2-digit numbers, the first digit can't be 0, but the second digit can be 0. So in the count of numbers without 4 or 5, I think I did it correctly. For example, in 2-digit numbers, first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So 4*5=20, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 3-digit numbers, first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 each, so 4*5*5=100. Correct.\n\nAnd 4-digit number: only 1000_7, which is 1 number without 4 or 5.\n\nSo total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 +1 = 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Wait, when I count the numbers without 4 or 5, am I including 0? Because in the 1-digit numbers, I only considered 1-6, so 4 numbers without 4 or 5. Similarly, for 2-digit numbers, the first digit is 1-6, so no 0. So I think the count is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another way to approach it is to consider that each digit can be 0-6, but excluding 4 and 5, so 5 choices for each digit except the first, which has 6 choices (1-6). But wait, no, because we're excluding 4 and 5, so the first digit would have 4 choices (1,2,3,6), and the other digits would have 5 choices each (0,1,2,3,6).\n\nSo for numbers with n digits, the count without 4 or 5 would be:\n\n1-digit: 4\n\n2-digit: 4*5\n\n3-digit: 4*5^2\n\n4-digit: 4*5^3? Wait, no, because 4-digit numbers in base 7 go up to 1000_7, which is 343. So how many 4-digit numbers are there? Only one, which is 1000_7, which is 343. So in the 4-digit case, it's a special case because we're only going up to 343.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I considered 4-digit numbers as only 1000_7, which is 1 number. So the count is 1, which is without 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider all possible 4-digit numbers in base 7, they would go from 1000_7 (343) to 6666_7 (2400 in decimal), but since we're only going up to 343, we only have 1000_7 as the 4-digit number. So in that case, the count for 4-digit numbers without 4 or 5 is 1.\n\nSo, total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 +1 = 125.\n\nThus, total numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Maybe using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nAlternatively, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is equal to the number of numbers with at least one 4 plus the number with at least one 5 minus the number with at least one 4 and 5.\n\nBut that might complicate things more, because it's easier to do complementary counting as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as for each digit position, how many numbers have 4 or 5 in that position, but that might involve inclusion-exclusion as well.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the first method. So, I think the answer is 218.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more.\n\nTotal numbers: 343.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5:\n\n1-digit: 4 (1,2,3,6)\n\n2-digit: 4*5=20\n\n3-digit:4*5*5=100\n\n4-digit:1 (1000_7)\n\nTotal:4+20=24, +100=124, +1=125.\n\nSo 343-125=218.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 343-125=218.\n\nBut wait, 343-125: 343-100=243, 243-25=218. Correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 218.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of integers is \\boxed{218}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit, we start by considering the numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, which correspond to numbers from 1 to 1000_7 in base 7.\n\nWe use complementary counting to find the numbers that do not contain the digits 4 or 5. \n\n1. **1-digit numbers (1 to 6 in base 7):**\n   - Digits allowed: 1, 2, 3, 6 (4 options)\n   - Count: 4\n\n2. **2-digit numbers (10_7 to 66_7 in base 7):**\n   - First digit: 1, 2, 3, 6 (4 options)\n   - Second digit: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 (5 options)\n   - Count: \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\)\n\n3. **3-digit numbers (100_7 to 666_7 in base 7):**\n   - First digit: 1, 2, 3, 6 (4 options)\n   - Second and third digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 (5 options each)\n   - Count: \\(4 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 100\\)\n\n4. **4-digit numbers (1000_7 in base 7):**\n   - Only one number: 1000_7 (which does not contain 4 or 5)\n   - Count: 1\n\nAdding these counts together, the total number of numbers without any 4 or 5 is:\n\\[ 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125 \\]\n\nSubtracting this from the total number of integers (343), we get the number of integers that use 4 or 5 (or both):\n\\[ 343 - 125 = 218 \\]\n\nThus, the number of integers that use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit is \\(\\boxed{218}\\).",

So maybe the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 are the numbers from 1 up to 666_7, which is 342 in decimal. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, 343 in decimal is 1000_7, so the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be from 1_7 (which is 1 in decimal) up to 666_7 (which is 342 in decimal). So 343 numbers, but 666_7 is 342, so does that mean 343 is not included? Wait, 343 is 1000_7, so if we're including up to 343, then we're going up to 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number. So maybe the numbers we're considering are from 1_7 (1) up to 1000_7 (343), but in base 7, that's 1 to 1000_7, which includes 343 numbers. So in base 7, these numbers can have 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits. Hmm, okay.\n\nSo the problem is: how many of these numbers (from 1 to 343 in decimal, which is 1 to 1000_7 in base 7) have at least one digit that is 4 or 5. So, I think the way to approach this is using complementary counting. Instead of counting the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5, I can subtract the numbers that have no 4s or 5s from the total number of numbers. That should give me the count I need.\n\nTotal numbers: 343.\n\nNumbers without any 4 or 5: Each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. But wait, in base 7, the digits go from 0 to 6, so if we exclude 4 and 5, the allowed digits are 0,1,2,3,6. That's 5 digits. But we have to be careful because leading zeros aren't allowed. So, for numbers with 1 digit, 2 digits, 3 digits, and 4 digits in base 7, how many have no 4 or 5?\n\nWait, let me think. Let's break it down by the number of digits.\n\nFirst, let's consider how many numbers there are in base 7 with 1 digit, 2 digits, 3 digits, and 4 digits, and then count how many of each have no 4 or 5.\n\n1-digit numbers in base 7: 1 to 6. So 6 numbers. How many of these have no 4 or 5? Well, digits allowed are 1,2,3,6. So that's 4 numbers (1,2,3,6). Wait, but 0 is allowed as a digit, but in 1-digit numbers, 0 isn't considered a positive integer. So yes, 4 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\n2-digit numbers in base 7: The first digit can be 1-6, and the second digit can be 0-6. So total 6*7=42 numbers. Now, how many have no 4 or 5? For the first digit, allowed digits are 1,2,3,6 (4 options). For the second digit, allowed digits are 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So 4*5=20 numbers.\n\n3-digit numbers in base 7: First digit 1-6, second and third digits 0-6. Total 6*7*7=294 numbers. Numbers without 4 or 5: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options), third digit same as second. So 4*5*5=100 numbers.\n\n4-digit numbers in base 7: Only one 4-digit number, which is 1000_7 (343 in decimal). So how many 4-digit numbers are there? Well, 1 to 1000_7, which is 343 numbers. Wait, but 1000_7 is 343, so maybe we're only considering up to 3 digits? Wait, no, because 343 is a 4-digit number in base 7. So, do we include 1000_7? Let me check. The problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which would be 1 to 343. So yes, 1000_7 is included.\n\nSo 4-digit numbers in base 7: only 1000_7. Now, does 1000_7 have a 4 or 5? The digits are 1,0,0,0. So no, it doesn't have 4 or 5. So how many 4-digit numbers have no 4 or 5? Just 1, which is 1000_7.\n\nWait, but is 1000_7 the only 4-digit number? Yes, because 1000_7 is 343, and the next number would be 1001_7, which is 344, but we're only considering up to 343. So, yes, only one 4-digit number, which is 1000_7, and it doesn't have 4 or 5.\n\nSo now, let's add up the numbers without any 4 or 5.\n\n1-digit: 4\n2-digit: 20\n3-digit: 100\n4-digit: 1\nTotal without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. 4+20 is 24, plus 100 is 124, plus 1 is 125. So 125 numbers without any 4 or 5.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 3-digit numbers, first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 each, so 4*5*5=100. That's correct.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers, only 1000_7, which is 1 number. So yes, 125 total.\n\nTherefore, the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 are total numbers (343) minus numbers without 4 or 5 (125). So 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. 343 - 125 is 218? Wait, 343 - 125: 343 - 100 is 243, minus 25 is 218. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut hold on, let me make sure I didn't include 0 in the count. Because in base 7, 0 is not a positive integer, so when I was counting 1-digit numbers, I correctly excluded 0. Similarly, in 2-digit numbers, the first digit can't be 0, but the second digit can be 0. So in the count of numbers without 4 or 5, I think I did it correctly. For example, in 2-digit numbers, first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So 4*5=20, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 3-digit numbers, first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 each, so 4*5*5=100. Correct.\n\nAnd 4-digit number: only 1000_7, which is 1 number without 4 or 5.\n\nSo total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 +1 = 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Wait, when I count the numbers without 4 or 5, am I including 0? Because in the 1-digit numbers, I only considered 1-6, so 4 numbers without 4 or 5. Similarly, for 2-digit numbers, the first digit is 1-6, so no 0. So I think the count is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another way to approach it is to consider that each digit can be 0-6, but excluding 4 and 5, so 5 choices for each digit except the first, which has 6 choices (1-6). But wait, no, because we're excluding 4 and 5, so the first digit would have 4 choices (1,2,3,6), and the other digits would have 5 choices each (0,1,2,3,6).\n\nSo for numbers with n digits, the count without 4 or 5 would be:\n\n1-digit: 4\n\n2-digit: 4*5\n\n3-digit: 4*5^2\n\n4-digit: 4*5^3? Wait, no, because 4-digit numbers in base 7 go up to 1000_7, which is 343. So how many 4-digit numbers are there? Only one, which is 1000_7, which is 343. So in the 4-digit case, it's a special case because we're only going up to 343.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I considered 4-digit numbers as only 1000_7, which is 1 number. So the count is 1, which is without 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider all possible 4-digit numbers in base 7, they would go from 1000_7 (343) to 6666_7 (2400 in decimal), but since we're only going up to 343, we only have 1000_7 as the 4-digit number. So in that case, the count for 4-digit numbers without 4 or 5 is 1.\n\nSo, total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 +1 = 125.\n\nThus, total numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Maybe using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nAlternatively, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is equal to the number of numbers with at least one 4 plus the number with at least one 5 minus the number with at least one 4 and 5.\n\nBut that might complicate things more, because it's easier to do complementary counting as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as for each digit position, how many numbers have 4 or 5 in that position, but that might involve inclusion-exclusion as well.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the first method. So, I think the answer is 218.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more.\n\nTotal numbers: 343.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5:\n\n1-digit: 4 (1,2,3,6)\n\n2-digit: 4*5=20\n\n3-digit:4*5*5=100\n\n4-digit:1 (1000_7)\n\nTotal:4+20=24, +100=124, +1=125.\n\nSo 343-125=218.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 343-125=218.\n\nBut wait, 343-125: 343-100=243, 243-25=218. Correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 218.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of integers is \\boxed{218}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit, we start by considering the numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, which correspond to numbers from 1 to 1000_7 in base 7.\n\nWe use complementary counting to find the numbers that do not contain the digits 4 or 5. \n\n1. **1-digit numbers (1 to 6 in base 7):**\n   - Digits allowed: 1, 2, 3, 6 (4 options)\n   - Count: 4\n\n2. **2-digit numbers (10_7 to 66_7 in base 7):**\n   - First digit: 1, 2, 3, 6 (4 options)\n   - Second digit: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 (5 options)\n   - Count: \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\)\n\n3. **3-digit numbers (100_7 to 666_7 in base 7):**\n   - First digit: 1, 2, 3, 6 (4 options)\n   - Second and third digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 (5 options each)\n   - Count: \\(4 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 100\\)\n\n4. **4-digit numbers (1000_7 in base 7):**\n   - Only one number: 1000_7 (which does not contain 4 or 5)\n   - Count: 1\n\nAdding these counts together, the total number of numbers without any 4 or 5 is:\n\\[ 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125 \\]\n\nSubtracting this from the total number of integers (343), we get the number of integers that use 4 or 5 (or both):\n\\[ 343 - 125 = 218 \\]\n\nThus, the number of integers that use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit is \\(\\boxed{218}\\).",
