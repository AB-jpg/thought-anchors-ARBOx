    "rollout": " \n\nFirst, the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7. Since base 7 numbers go from 1 up to 7^3 - 1, because 7^3 is 343, right? So, the numbers we're considering are from 1 to 342 in base 10, but when written in base 7, they will have up to three digits. So, each number can be represented as a three-digit number in base 7, possibly with leading zeros. For example, the number 1 in base 7 is 001, 7 is 010, and so on up to 342, which is 666 in base 7.\n\nWait, actually, the number 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which is a four-digit number. So, the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would go from 1 up to 666 (base 7), which is 342 in base 10. So, we're considering all numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10, or 001 to 666 in base 7.\n\nNow, the problem is to find how many of these numbers have at least one digit that is 4 or 5 (or both) in their base 7 representation. So, we can approach this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Alternatively, it might be easier to calculate the total number of numbers that do NOT have 4 or 5 in any digit and then subtract that from the total number of numbers.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of three-digit numbers in base 7 (including leading zeros). Since each digit can be from 0 to 6, the total number is 7^3 = 343. But wait, the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so from 1 to 343 in base 10, but in base 7, 343 is 1000, so maybe we're only considering up to 666 (base 7), which is 342 in base 10. So, the total numbers to consider are 343, from 1 to 343 in base 10, but in base 7, that's 001 to 666, including 666, which is 342 in base 10. Wait, but 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which is a four-digit number, so perhaps the numbers go up to 666 (base 7) which is 342, so the count is 342 numbers, but the problem says 343 smallest positive integers. Hmm, maybe the count is from 1 to 343 in base 10, but in base 7, 343 is 1000, so we have numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which in base 7 would include three-digit numbers up to 666 (342) and then 1000 (343). So, perhaps the total numbers to consider are 343, which includes 1000 in base 7 as the 343rd number. But wait, the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so that would be 1 to 343 inclusive. So, in base 7, that's 001 to 1000, but 1000 is a four-digit number, so the three-digit numbers go up to 666, which is 342 in base 10. So, the 343 numbers include 342 three-digit numbers and 1 four-digit number (1000). Hmm, but maybe the problem is considering only three-digit numbers, so perhaps it's 1 to 343 in base 10, but written in base 7, which would include up to 1000, but maybe the question is only considering three-digit numbers, so perhaps we're only looking at 1 to 342 in base 10, which is 001 to 666 in base 7. I think that's the case because 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which is the first four-digit number, so the 343rd number is 1000 in base 7, which is a four-digit number. So, perhaps the problem is considering numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, including 1000 in base 7. Hmm, this is a bit confusing, but maybe I should proceed by considering all numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7, which is 343 numbers (including 000, which is 0 in base 10). But the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so starting from 1, which would be 001 in base 7 up to 666 (342) and 1000 (343). So, including 1000 in base 7 as the 343rd number. Therefore, when considering digits, 1000 has a 1 followed by three zeros, so it's a four-digit number. So, in total, the numbers to consider are from 1 to 343 in base 10, which in base 7 are from 001 to 1000. \n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, I can model all numbers as three-digit base 7 numbers, including leading zeros, so from 000 to 666, which is 343 numbers. But since the problem is about positive integers, starting from 1, so 001 to 666 in base 7, which is 342 numbers, plus 1000 (343 in base 10) as the 343rd number. So, perhaps I should consider numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7, which is 343 numbers, but excluding 000 because we're only considering positive integers, so 1 to 343 in base 10, which includes 343 numbers in base 7 from 001 to 1000. \n\nThis is a bit confusing, but maybe I can proceed by considering all three-digit numbers in base 7, including leading zeros, so from 000 to 666, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract 1 for the number 000, which is not a positive integer, so we have 342 numbers. But the problem says 343 smallest positive integers, so perhaps it's better to include 1000 (base 7) as the 343rd number. So, I have to consider numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which in base 7 are 001 to 1000. \n\nBut maybe it's easier to model all numbers as three-digit base 7 numbers, including leading zeros, from 000 to 666, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract the count for 000, which is not a positive integer, so 342 numbers. But then, the 343rd number is 1000 in base 7, which is outside the three-digit range. Hmm, perhaps I should consider all numbers from 000 to 666 (343 numbers) and then adjust for the fact that we're starting from 1. Alternatively, maybe I should just model the numbers as three-digit base 7 numbers, from 000 to 666, and calculate how many of these have at least one digit as 4 or 5, and then subtract the case where all digits are 0 (i.e., 000). But the problem is about positive integers, so 000 is excluded. So, perhaps I can calculate the number of three-digit base 7 numbers (including leading zeros) that have at least one 4 or 5, which would be 343 minus the number of numbers that have no 4 or 5 in any digit. Then, since 000 is excluded, I have to subtract 1 if 000 is counted in that.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as three-digit numbers, including leading zeros, so each digit can be 0 to 6, and the total is 343. The number of numbers without any 4 or 5 would be numbers where each digit is 0,1,2,3,6. So, for each digit, there are 5 choices, so total numbers without 4 or 5 are 5^3 = 125. So, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218. But wait, this includes 000, which is not a positive integer. So, if we exclude 000, then the total positive integers would be 342, and the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 would be 125 - 1 = 124, because 000 is one of the 125 numbers without 4 or 5. Therefore, the number of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 would be 342 - 124 = 218. Wait, that's the same number, so maybe it doesn't matter because 000 is not included in the count of positive integers, so when we subtract 125 (which includes 000) from 343, we get 218, but since 000 isn't a positive integer, the count of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 is still 218. Wait, no, because 343 includes 000, and we're considering positive integers from 1 to 343, which is 343 numbers, but 000 is excluded, so maybe the count is 343 - 1 = 342, and the number without 4 or 5 is 125 - 1 = 124, so 342 - 124 = 218. So, the answer would be 218.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this approach again. The total number of positive integers from 1 to 343 in base 10 is 343. When written in base 7, these are represented as numbers from 001 to 1000. But 1000 is a four-digit number, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, considering all numbers as three-digit base 7 numbers, from 000 to 666, which is 343 numbers, and then excluding 000, we have 342 positive integers. The number of numbers without any 4 or 5 in their digits would be 5^3 = 125, which includes 000. So, the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 is 125 - 1 = 124. Therefore, the number of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 is 342 - 124 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is 343 the correct total? Because 7^3 is 343, which is the number of three-digit numbers in base 7 including 000. So, if we're considering positive integers from 1 to 343, that's 343 numbers, but when written in base 7, 343 is 1000, which is a four-digit number. So, perhaps the count is 343 numbers, with the last one being 1000. But when we count the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, their base 7 representations go up to 1000, which is four digits. So, how does this affect the count? Maybe I should treat the four-digit number 1000 separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the numbers as three-digit base 7 numbers, from 000 to 666, which is 343 numbers, and then note that 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which is outside this range. So, the numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10 correspond to 001 to 666 in base 7, which are three-digit numbers, and then 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, a four-digit number. Therefore, the 343rd number is 1000, which is a four-digit number. So, perhaps the problem is asking about numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, so including 1000 in base 7. So, in that case, when considering the digits, 1000 has a 1 followed by three zeros, so no 4 or 5, so it doesn't contribute to the count we're looking for.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the total number of numbers to consider is 343, and the number of numbers without any 4 or 5 is 125, which includes 000. But since we're starting from 1, the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 is 125 - 1 = 124, as 000 is excluded. Therefore, the number of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 124 = 219. Wait, that's different from before. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, if the total numbers are 343, from 1 to 343 in base 10, and in base 7, 343 is 1000, which is a four-digit number. So, perhaps the count of numbers without 4 or 5 in base 7 includes all three-digit numbers without 4 or 5, which is 125, and then 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in base 10, which doesn't have any 4 or 5. So, the total numbers without 4 or 5 would be 125 (three-digit numbers without 4 or 5) plus 1 (the four-digit number 1000), totaling 126. Therefore, the number of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 would be 343 - 126 = 217.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to structure it properly.\n\nApproach:\n\n1. The problem is about numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which in base 7 range from 1 (001) up to 343 (1000).\n\n2. We need to count how many of these numbers, when written in base 7, have at least one digit that is 4 or 5.\n\n3. To find this, it's easier to calculate the total numbers without any 4 or 5 and subtract that from the total number of numbers.\n\n4. The total numbers are 343.\n\n5. Now, count how many numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, when written in base 7, have no 4 or 5 in any digit.\n\n6. Let's break this down:\n\n   a. Numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10 correspond to base 7 numbers from 001 to 666.\n\n   b. The number 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7.\n\n7. So, we can consider two parts:\n\n   a. The three-digit base 7 numbers from 001 to 666 (which is 342 numbers).\n\n   b. The four-digit number 1000 (which is 343 in base 10).\n\n8. Now, count how many numbers in each part do NOT have 4 or 5 in any digit.\n\n   a. For three-digit numbers (001 to 666), each digit can be 0-6. But since we're excluding 4 and 5, each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. However, the first digit (hundreds place) can be 0, but since we're considering positive integers, the first digit can be 0 only if the number is less than 100 in base 7, which corresponds to numbers less than 49 in base 10. But wait, in the three-digit representation, 001 is 1, 002 is 2, etc., up to 066, which is 48 in base 10. Then, from 100 (49) to 666 (342) in base 7. So, for numbers from 1 to 342, in base 7, they can be represented as three-digit numbers with leading zeros.\n\n   b. So, for the three-digit numbers, each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (excluding 4 and 5). However, the first digit (hundreds place) can be 0, but if it's 0, then the number is effectively a two-digit or one-digit number. But since we're considering all three-digit numbers with leading zeros, we can include 000, but we have to exclude it because we're only considering positive integers.\n\n   c. So, the number of three-digit base 7 numbers without 4 or 5 is 5 options for each digit: 5^3 = 125. But this includes 000, which is not a positive integer. So, the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 in the three-digit numbers is 125 - 1 = 124.\n\n   d. Now, consider the four-digit number 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in base 10. This number has digits 1,0,0,0. So, it doesn't have any 4 or 5. Therefore, it should be included in the count of numbers without 4 or 5.\n\n   e. Therefore, the total number of positive integers from 1 to 343 without any 4 or 5 in base 7 is 124 (three-digit numbers) + 1 (1000) = 125.\n\n   f. Therefore, the number of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 is total numbers (343) minus numbers without 4 or 5 (125), which is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, that seems consistent now. So, the final answer is 218.\n\nBut let me verify again step by step.\n\nTotal numbers: 343 (from 1 to 343 in base 10).\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5 in base 7:\n\n- Three-digit numbers (001 to 666 in base 7, which is 1 to 342 in base 10): Each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. So, 5 choices per digit, 5^3 = 125. But this includes 000, which is not a positive integer, so 125 - 1 = 124.\n\n- The number 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which has no 4 or 5, so add 1.\n\nTotal numbers without 4 or 5: 124 + 1 = 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of valid numbers without 4 or 5, then subtract",

Problem: How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 or both. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7. Since base 7 numbers go from 1 up to 7^3 - 1, because 7^3 is 343, right? So, the numbers we're considering are from 1 to 342 in base 10, but when written in base 7, they will have up to three digits. So, each number can be represented as a three-digit number in base 7, possibly with leading zeros. For example, the number 1 in base 7 is 001, 7 is 010, and so on up to 342, which is 666 in base 7.\n\nWait, actually, the number 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which is a four-digit number. So, the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would go from 1 up to 666 (base 7), which is 342 in base 10. So, we're considering all numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10, or 001 to 666 in base 7.\n\nNow, the problem is to find how many of these numbers have at least one digit that is 4 or 5 (or both) in their base 7 representation. So, we can approach this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Alternatively, it might be easier to calculate the total number of numbers that do NOT have 4 or 5 in any digit and then subtract that from the total number of numbers.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of three-digit numbers in base 7 (including leading zeros). Since each digit can be from 0 to 6, the total number is 7^3 = 343. But wait, the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so from 1 to 343 in base 10, but in base 7, 343 is 1000, so maybe we're only considering up to 666 (base 7), which is 342 in base 10. So, the total numbers to consider are 343, from 1 to 343 in base 10, but in base 7, that's 001 to 666, including 666, which is 342 in base 10. Wait, but 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which is a four-digit number, so perhaps the numbers go up to 666 (base 7) which is 342, so the count is 342 numbers, but the problem says 343 smallest positive integers. Hmm, maybe the count is from 1 to 343 in base 10, but in base 7, 343 is 1000, so we have numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which in base 7 would include three-digit numbers up to 666 (342) and then 1000 (343). So, perhaps the total numbers to consider are 343, which includes 1000 in base 7 as the 343rd number. But wait, the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so that would be 1 to 343 inclusive. So, in base 7, that's 001 to 1000, but 1000 is a four-digit number, so the three-digit numbers go up to 666, which is 342 in base 10. So, the 343 numbers include 342 three-digit numbers and 1 four-digit number (1000). Hmm, but maybe the problem is considering only three-digit numbers, so perhaps it's 1 to 343 in base 10, but written in base 7, which would include up to 1000, but maybe the question is only considering three-digit numbers, so perhaps we're only looking at 1 to 342 in base 10, which is 001 to 666 in base 7. I think that's the case because 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which is the first four-digit number, so the 343rd number is 1000 in base 7, which is a four-digit number. So, perhaps the problem is considering numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, including 1000 in base 7. Hmm, this is a bit confusing, but maybe I should proceed by considering all numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7, which is 343 numbers (including 000, which is 0 in base 10). But the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so starting from 1, which would be 001 in base 7 up to 666 (342) and 1000 (343). So, including 1000 in base 7 as the 343rd number. Therefore, when considering digits, 1000 has a 1 followed by three zeros, so it's a four-digit number. So, in total, the numbers to consider are from 1 to 343 in base 10, which in base 7 are from 001 to 1000. \n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, I can model all numbers as three-digit base 7 numbers, including leading zeros, so from 000 to 666, which is 343 numbers. But since the problem is about positive integers, starting from 1, so 001 to 666 in base 7, which is 342 numbers, plus 1000 (343 in base 10) as the 343rd number. So, perhaps I should consider numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7, which is 343 numbers, but excluding 000 because we're only considering positive integers, so 1 to 343 in base 10, which includes 343 numbers in base 7 from 001 to 1000. \n\nThis is a bit confusing, but maybe I can proceed by considering all three-digit numbers in base 7, including leading zeros, so from 000 to 666, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract 1 for the number 000, which is not a positive integer, so we have 342 numbers. But the problem says 343 smallest positive integers, so perhaps it's better to include 1000 (base 7) as the 343rd number. So, I have to consider numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which in base 7 are 001 to 1000. \n\nBut maybe it's easier to model all numbers as three-digit base 7 numbers, including leading zeros, from 000 to 666, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract the count for 000, which is not a positive integer, so 342 numbers. But then, the 343rd number is 1000 in base 7, which is outside the three-digit range. Hmm, perhaps I should consider all numbers from 000 to 666 (343 numbers) and then adjust for the fact that we're starting from 1. Alternatively, maybe I should just model the numbers as three-digit base 7 numbers, from 000 to 666, and calculate how many of these have at least one digit as 4 or 5, and then subtract the case where all digits are 0 (i.e., 000). But the problem is about positive integers, so 000 is excluded. So, perhaps I can calculate the number of three-digit base 7 numbers (including leading zeros) that have at least one 4 or 5, which would be 343 minus the number of numbers that have no 4 or 5 in any digit. Then, since 000 is excluded, I have to subtract 1 if 000 is counted in that.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as three-digit numbers, including leading zeros, so each digit can be 0 to 6, and the total is 343. The number of numbers without any 4 or 5 would be numbers where each digit is 0,1,2,3,6. So, for each digit, there are 5 choices, so total numbers without 4 or 5 are 5^3 = 125. So, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218. But wait, this includes 000, which is not a positive integer. So, if we exclude 000, then the total positive integers would be 342, and the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 would be 125 - 1 = 124, because 000 is one of the 125 numbers without 4 or 5. Therefore, the number of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 would be 342 - 124 = 218. Wait, that's the same number, so maybe it doesn't matter because 000 is not included in the count of positive integers, so when we subtract 125 (which includes 000) from 343, we get 218, but since 000 isn't a positive integer, the count of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 is still 218. Wait, no, because 343 includes 000, and we're considering positive integers from 1 to 343, which is 343 numbers, but 000 is excluded, so maybe the count is 343 - 1 = 342, and the number without 4 or 5 is 125 - 1 = 124, so 342 - 124 = 218. So, the answer would be 218.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this approach again. The total number of positive integers from 1 to 343 in base 10 is 343. When written in base 7, these are represented as numbers from 001 to 1000. But 1000 is a four-digit number, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, considering all numbers as three-digit base 7 numbers, from 000 to 666, which is 343 numbers, and then excluding 000, we have 342 positive integers. The number of numbers without any 4 or 5 in their digits would be 5^3 = 125, which includes 000. So, the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 is 125 - 1 = 124. Therefore, the number of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 is 342 - 124 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is 343 the correct total? Because 7^3 is 343, which is the number of three-digit numbers in base 7 including 000. So, if we're considering positive integers from 1 to 343, that's 343 numbers, but when written in base 7, 343 is 1000, which is a four-digit number. So, perhaps the count is 343 numbers, with the last one being 1000. But when we count the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, their base 7 representations go up to 1000, which is four digits. So, how does this affect the count? Maybe I should treat the four-digit number 1000 separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the numbers as three-digit base 7 numbers, from 000 to 666, which is 343 numbers, and then note that 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which is outside this range. So, the numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10 correspond to 001 to 666 in base 7, which are three-digit numbers, and then 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, a four-digit number. Therefore, the 343rd number is 1000, which is a four-digit number. So, perhaps the problem is asking about numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, so including 1000 in base 7. So, in that case, when considering the digits, 1000 has a 1 followed by three zeros, so no 4 or 5, so it doesn't contribute to the count we're looking for.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the total number of numbers to consider is 343, and the number of numbers without any 4 or 5 is 125, which includes 000. But since we're starting from 1, the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 is 125 - 1 = 124, as 000 is excluded. Therefore, the number of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 124 = 219. Wait, that's different from before. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, if the total numbers are 343, from 1 to 343 in base 10, and in base 7, 343 is 1000, which is a four-digit number. So, perhaps the count of numbers without 4 or 5 in base 7 includes all three-digit numbers without 4 or 5, which is 125, and then 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in base 10, which doesn't have any 4 or 5. So, the total numbers without 4 or 5 would be 125 (three-digit numbers without 4 or 5) plus 1 (the four-digit number 1000), totaling 126. Therefore, the number of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 would be 343 - 126 = 217.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to structure it properly.\n\nApproach:\n\n1. The problem is about numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which in base 7 range from 1 (001) up to 343 (1000).\n\n2. We need to count how many of these numbers, when written in base 7, have at least one digit that is 4 or 5.\n\n3. To find this, it's easier to calculate the total numbers without any 4 or 5 and subtract that from the total number of numbers.\n\n4. The total numbers are 343.\n\n5. Now, count how many numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, when written in base 7, have no 4 or 5 in any digit.\n\n6. Let's break this down:\n\n   a. Numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10 correspond to base 7 numbers from 001 to 666.\n\n   b. The number 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7.\n\n7. So, we can consider two parts:\n\n   a. The three-digit base 7 numbers from 001 to 666 (which is 342 numbers).\n\n   b. The four-digit number 1000 (which is 343 in base 10).\n\n8. Now, count how many numbers in each part do NOT have 4 or 5 in any digit.\n\n   a. For three-digit numbers (001 to 666), each digit can be 0-6. But since we're excluding 4 and 5, each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. However, the first digit (hundreds place) can be 0, but since we're considering positive integers, the first digit can be 0 only if the number is less than 100 in base 7, which corresponds to numbers less than 49 in base 10. But wait, in the three-digit representation, 001 is 1, 002 is 2, etc., up to 066, which is 48 in base 10. Then, from 100 (49) to 666 (342) in base 7. So, for numbers from 1 to 342, in base 7, they can be represented as three-digit numbers with leading zeros.\n\n   b. So, for the three-digit numbers, each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (excluding 4 and 5). However, the first digit (hundreds place) can be 0, but if it's 0, then the number is effectively a two-digit or one-digit number. But since we're considering all three-digit numbers with leading zeros, we can include 000, but we have to exclude it because we're only considering positive integers.\n\n   c. So, the number of three-digit base 7 numbers without 4 or 5 is 5 options for each digit: 5^3 = 125. But this includes 000, which is not a positive integer. So, the number of positive integers without 4 or 5 in the three-digit numbers is 125 - 1 = 124.\n\n   d. Now, consider the four-digit number 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in base 10. This number has digits 1,0,0,0. So, it doesn't have any 4 or 5. Therefore, it should be included in the count of numbers without 4 or 5.\n\n   e. Therefore, the total number of positive integers from 1 to 343 without any 4 or 5 in base 7 is 124 (three-digit numbers) + 1 (1000) = 125.\n\n   f. Therefore, the number of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 is total numbers (343) minus numbers without 4 or 5 (125), which is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, that seems consistent now. So, the final answer is 218.\n\nBut let me verify again step by step.\n\nTotal numbers: 343 (from 1 to 343 in base 10).\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5 in base 7:\n\n- Three-digit numbers (001 to 666 in base 7, which is 1 to 342 in base 10): Each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. So, 5 choices per digit, 5^3 = 125. But this includes 000, which is not a positive integer, so 125 - 1 = 124.\n\n- The number 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, which has no 4 or 5, so add 1.\n\nTotal numbers without 4 or 5: 124 + 1 = 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of valid numbers without 4 or 5, then subtract",

So, in base 7, 343 would be represented as 1000_7, right? That makes sense because 7^3 is 343, so the next number after 666_7 would be 1000_7. So, the numbers we're considering are from 1_7 up to 666_7 in base 7.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many of these numbers use 4 or 5 as a digit. So, I need to count how many numbers in base 7 from 1 to 666_7 have at least one digit that is 4 or 5. \n\nI remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the total number of possibilities and then subtract the ones that don't meet the criteria. So, maybe I can use the complementary counting method here. Instead of counting the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5, I can count how many numbers don't have any 4s or 5s and subtract that from the total number of numbers.\n\nLet me define the total number of numbers as N_total. Since we're considering numbers from 1 to 666_7, which is 343 in base 10, N_total is 343. But wait, actually, in base 7, the number 666_7 is 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342. So, 666_7 is 342 in base 10, and 1000_7 is 343. So, the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 correspond to 1_7 up to 666_7 and 1000_7. Wait, but 1000_7 is 343, so the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 include 343 numbers. So, when writing in base 7, numbers from 1_7 (which is 1) up to 666_7 (which is 342) and 1000_7 (343). So, we have 343 numbers in total.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify. The number 343 in base 10 is 1000_7, which is the next number after 666_7. So, the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 include 1_7 up to 666_7, which is 342 numbers, plus 1000_7, which is 343. So, in total, 343 numbers.\n\nNow, I need to count how many of these 343 numbers have at least one digit 4 or 5 in their base 7 representation. Instead of counting directly, I'll find the total number of numbers without any 4 or 5 and subtract that from 343.\n\nSo, let me find N_no45, the number of numbers from 1 to 342 (since 343 is 1000_7, which doesn't have any digits except 1 and 0, so it's included in N_no45) that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit.\n\nIn base 7, each digit can be 0 to 6. But since we're excluding 4 and 5, the allowed digits are 0,1,2,3,6. So, for each digit, we have 5 choices.\n\nBut wait, the numbers from 1 to 342 in base 7 can have 1, 2, or 3 digits. So, let's consider numbers with 1 digit, 2 digits, and 3 digits separately.\n\nFirst, 1-digit numbers in base 7: 1 to 6. So, total 6 numbers. How many of these don't have 4 or 5? The allowed digits are 1,2,3,6. So, 4 numbers.\n\nWait, but in base 7, 1-digit numbers are 1 to 6, so if we exclude 4 and 5, the allowed digits are 1,2,3,6, which is 4 digits. So, N_no45 for 1-digit numbers is 4.\n\nNext, 2-digit numbers in base 7. The first digit can be 1 to 6 (since leading zeros are not allowed), and the second digit can be 0 to 6.\n\nBut since we're excluding 4 and 5, the first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), and the second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So, total 2-digit numbers without 4 or 5 is 4*5 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, 3-digit numbers in base 7. The first digit can be 1 to 6, the second and third digits can be 0 to 6. Excluding 4 and 5, the first digit has 4 choices, and the second and third digits have 5 choices each. So, 4*5*5 = 100.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check. The 3-digit numbers in base 7 go up to 666_7, which is 342 in base 10. So, including 100_7 up to 666_7. So, the count is correct: 4*5*5=100.\n\nAdditionally, we have the number 1000_7, which is 343 in base 10. As I mentioned earlier, 1000_7 doesn't have any 4 or 5, so it should be included in N_no45. So, N_no45 = 4 (1-digit) + 20 (2-digit) + 100 (3-digit) +1 (1000_7) = 125.\n\nWait, but hold on. The number 1000_7 is 343, which is the 343rd number. So, in our total N_total, we have 343 numbers, from 1 to 343. So, when calculating N_no45, we should include 1000_7 as it's part of the 343 numbers and doesn't have any 4 or 5.\n\nSo, N_no45 = 4 + 20 + 100 +1 = 125.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 is N_total - N_no45 = 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for 1-digit numbers: 1 to 6, excluding 4 and 5, so allowed digits are 1,2,3,6: 4 numbers. Correct.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So, 4*5=20. Correct.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices), third digit same as second: 5 choices. So, 4*5*5=100. Correct.\n\nPlus the number 1000_7, which is 343, which doesn't have any 4 or 5, so +1. So, total N_no45=4+20+100+1=125.\n\nTherefore, the numbers with at least one 4 or 5 are 343-125=218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is 1000_7 included in the count? Because the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" which would be 1 to 343 inclusive. So, 343 numbers.\n\nSo, when calculating N_no45, we include 1000_7 as it's part of the 343 numbers. So, yes, 125 is correct.\n\nBut wait another thing: when we count N_no45, are we including 0? Because in our N_no45, we included 0 as a possible digit in the second and third places. But in reality, the numbers we're considering start from 1, so 0 is not included as a number. Wait, no, because we're considering numbers from 1 to 343, so 0 isn't part of the count. So, does that affect our calculation?\n\nWait, let me clarify. When we count the numbers without 4 or 5, we're considering numbers from 1 to 343, so we shouldn't include 0. But in our calculation, for 2-digit and 3-digit numbers, we allowed the second and third digits to be 0, but the first digit is non-zero. So, the numbers counted in N_no45 are from 1 to 343, so 0 isn't included. So, our calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: for example, the number 10_7 is 7 in base 10, which is included, and it's a valid number without 4 or 5. So, our calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, N_no45=125, so the numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343-125=218.\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the total numbers are 343, from 1 to 343. N_no45 is the count of numbers from 1 to 343 that don't have any 4 or 5 in any digit. So, when I calculated N_no45 as 125, that includes 1000_7, which is 343. So, yes, 125 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I should use another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 by considering each digit position.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to stick with the first method since it seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 3-digit numbers again. When I calculated N_no45 for 3-digit numbers as 100, that's correct because the first digit has 4 choices, and the next two digits have 5 choices each. So, 4*5*5=100.\n\nSimilarly, 2-digit numbers: 4*5=20.\n\n1-digit numbers: 4.\n\nPlus 1000_7: 1.\n\nTotal N_no45=125.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343-125=218.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me check if 1000_7 is correctly included. Since 1000_7 is 343, which is the last number, and it's included in the count, so yes, N_no45 includes it.\n\nBut let me make sure that in N_no45, we're not including numbers beyond 343. Since 1000_7 is exactly 343, so it's included, and all other numbers are less than 343, so our count is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in including 1000_7. Because 1000_7 is 343, which is the last number, but when we count from 1 to 343, we have 343 numbers. So, N_no45 includes 1000_7, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 7 include 1_7 up to 666_7 and 1000_7. So, in base 7, the numbers have up to 4 digits, but 1000_7 is a 4-digit number. However, when considering the digits, 1000_7 only has 1 and 0, so it's included in N_no45.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers that use 4 or 5 or both as a digit is 218.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 that use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit is calculated by subtracting the count of numbers without 4 or 5 from the total. \n\nStep-by-step:\n1. Total numbers: 343 (from 1 to 343 in base 10).\n2. Numbers without 4 or 5:\n   - 1-digit: 4 numbers (1,2,3,6).\n   - 2-digit: 4\u00d75=20 numbers.\n   - 3-digit: 4\u00d75\u00d75=100 numbers.\n   - 1000_7 (343): 1 number.\n3. Total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n4. Numbers with 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{218}",

Problem: How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 or both. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be the numbers from 1 up to 343. But wait, 343 is actually 7^3, which is 343 in base 10. So, in base 7, 343 would be represented as 1000_7, right? That makes sense because 7^3 is 343, so the next number after 666_7 would be 1000_7. So, the numbers we're considering are from 1_7 up to 666_7 in base 7.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many of these numbers use 4 or 5 as a digit. So, I need to count how many numbers in base 7 from 1 to 666_7 have at least one digit that is 4 or 5. \n\nI remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the total number of possibilities and then subtract the ones that don't meet the criteria. So, maybe I can use the complementary counting method here. Instead of counting the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5, I can count how many numbers don't have any 4s or 5s and subtract that from the total number of numbers.\n\nLet me define the total number of numbers as N_total. Since we're considering numbers from 1 to 666_7, which is 343 in base 10, N_total is 343. But wait, actually, in base 7, the number 666_7 is 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342. So, 666_7 is 342 in base 10, and 1000_7 is 343. So, the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 correspond to 1_7 up to 666_7 and 1000_7. Wait, but 1000_7 is 343, so the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 include 343 numbers. So, when writing in base 7, numbers from 1_7 (which is 1) up to 666_7 (which is 342) and 1000_7 (343). So, we have 343 numbers in total.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify. The number 343 in base 10 is 1000_7, which is the next number after 666_7. So, the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 include 1_7 up to 666_7, which is 342 numbers, plus 1000_7, which is 343. So, in total, 343 numbers.\n\nNow, I need to count how many of these 343 numbers have at least one digit 4 or 5 in their base 7 representation. Instead of counting directly, I'll find the total number of numbers without any 4 or 5 and subtract that from 343.\n\nSo, let me find N_no45, the number of numbers from 1 to 342 (since 343 is 1000_7, which doesn't have any digits except 1 and 0, so it's included in N_no45) that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit.\n\nIn base 7, each digit can be 0 to 6. But since we're excluding 4 and 5, the allowed digits are 0,1,2,3,6. So, for each digit, we have 5 choices.\n\nBut wait, the numbers from 1 to 342 in base 7 can have 1, 2, or 3 digits. So, let's consider numbers with 1 digit, 2 digits, and 3 digits separately.\n\nFirst, 1-digit numbers in base 7: 1 to 6. So, total 6 numbers. How many of these don't have 4 or 5? The allowed digits are 1,2,3,6. So, 4 numbers.\n\nWait, but in base 7, 1-digit numbers are 1 to 6, so if we exclude 4 and 5, the allowed digits are 1,2,3,6, which is 4 digits. So, N_no45 for 1-digit numbers is 4.\n\nNext, 2-digit numbers in base 7. The first digit can be 1 to 6 (since leading zeros are not allowed), and the second digit can be 0 to 6.\n\nBut since we're excluding 4 and 5, the first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), and the second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So, total 2-digit numbers without 4 or 5 is 4*5 = 20.\n\nSimilarly, 3-digit numbers in base 7. The first digit can be 1 to 6, the second and third digits can be 0 to 6. Excluding 4 and 5, the first digit has 4 choices, and the second and third digits have 5 choices each. So, 4*5*5 = 100.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check. The 3-digit numbers in base 7 go up to 666_7, which is 342 in base 10. So, including 100_7 up to 666_7. So, the count is correct: 4*5*5=100.\n\nAdditionally, we have the number 1000_7, which is 343 in base 10. As I mentioned earlier, 1000_7 doesn't have any 4 or 5, so it should be included in N_no45. So, N_no45 = 4 (1-digit) + 20 (2-digit) + 100 (3-digit) +1 (1000_7) = 125.\n\nWait, but hold on. The number 1000_7 is 343, which is the 343rd number. So, in our total N_total, we have 343 numbers, from 1 to 343. So, when calculating N_no45, we should include 1000_7 as it's part of the 343 numbers and doesn't have any 4 or 5.\n\nSo, N_no45 = 4 + 20 + 100 +1 = 125.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 is N_total - N_no45 = 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for 1-digit numbers: 1 to 6, excluding 4 and 5, so allowed digits are 1,2,3,6: 4 numbers. Correct.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So, 4*5=20. Correct.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices), third digit same as second: 5 choices. So, 4*5*5=100. Correct.\n\nPlus the number 1000_7, which is 343, which doesn't have any 4 or 5, so +1. So, total N_no45=4+20+100+1=125.\n\nTherefore, the numbers with at least one 4 or 5 are 343-125=218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is 1000_7 included in the count? Because the problem says \"the 343 smallest positive integers,\" which would be 1 to 343 inclusive. So, 343 numbers.\n\nSo, when calculating N_no45, we include 1000_7 as it's part of the 343 numbers. So, yes, 125 is correct.\n\nBut wait another thing: when we count N_no45, are we including 0? Because in our N_no45, we included 0 as a possible digit in the second and third places. But in reality, the numbers we're considering start from 1, so 0 is not included as a number. Wait, no, because we're considering numbers from 1 to 343, so 0 isn't part of the count. So, does that affect our calculation?\n\nWait, let me clarify. When we count the numbers without 4 or 5, we're considering numbers from 1 to 343, so we shouldn't include 0. But in our calculation, for 2-digit and 3-digit numbers, we allowed the second and third digits to be 0, but the first digit is non-zero. So, the numbers counted in N_no45 are from 1 to 343, so 0 isn't included. So, our calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: for example, the number 10_7 is 7 in base 10, which is included, and it's a valid number without 4 or 5. So, our calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, N_no45=125, so the numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343-125=218.\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the total numbers are 343, from 1 to 343. N_no45 is the count of numbers from 1 to 343 that don't have any 4 or 5 in any digit. So, when I calculated N_no45 as 125, that includes 1000_7, which is 343. So, yes, 125 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I should use another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 by considering each digit position.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to stick with the first method since it seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 3-digit numbers again. When I calculated N_no45 for 3-digit numbers as 100, that's correct because the first digit has 4 choices, and the next two digits have 5 choices each. So, 4*5*5=100.\n\nSimilarly, 2-digit numbers: 4*5=20.\n\n1-digit numbers: 4.\n\nPlus 1000_7: 1.\n\nTotal N_no45=125.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343-125=218.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me check if 1000_7 is correctly included. Since 1000_7 is 343, which is the last number, and it's included in the count, so yes, N_no45 includes it.\n\nBut let me make sure that in N_no45, we're not including numbers beyond 343. Since 1000_7 is exactly 343, so it's included, and all other numbers are less than 343, so our count is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in including 1000_7. Because 1000_7 is 343, which is the last number, but when we count from 1 to 343, we have 343 numbers. So, N_no45 includes 1000_7, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 7 include 1_7 up to 666_7 and 1000_7. So, in base 7, the numbers have up to 4 digits, but 1000_7 is a 4-digit number. However, when considering the digits, 1000_7 only has 1 and 0, so it's included in N_no45.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers that use 4 or 5 or both as a digit is 218.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 that use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit is calculated by subtracting the count of numbers without 4 or 5 from the total. \n\nStep-by-step:\n1. Total numbers: 343 (from 1 to 343 in base 10).\n2. Numbers without 4 or 5:\n   - 1-digit: 4 numbers (1,2,3,6).\n   - 2-digit: 4\u00d75=20 numbers.\n   - 3-digit: 4\u00d75\u00d75=100 numbers.\n   - 1000_7 (343): 1 number.\n3. Total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n4. Numbers with 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{218}",

But wait, the problem is about base 7, so I think it's referring to the numbers from 1 up to 343 in base 10, but when converted to base 7, how many of those numbers have at least one digit that's either 4 or 5. Alternatively, maybe it's about numbers in base 7 up to 343, but 343 in base 10 is actually 1000 in base 7 because 7^3 = 343. So, the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be from 1 up to 666 in base 7, but that might not be correct. Wait, no, because 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7. So, the numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10 would be represented as 1 to 666 in base 7. But the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so maybe it's up to 343, which is 1000 in base 7, but including that? Hmm, but 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, so maybe the problem is considering numbers from 1 to 343 (base 10) and converting them to base 7, then counting how many have at least one 4 or 5 in their digits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about numbers in base 7 up to 343, but that seems conflicting because 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, so the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 correspond to 1 to 1000 in base 7. So, the problem is asking how many numbers from 1 to 343 (base 10) when written in base 7 have at least one digit that's 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but 343 is 7^3, so in base 7, it's a 4-digit number: 1 0 0 0. So, the numbers we're considering are all 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers in base 7 up to 1000 (base 7). So, perhaps it's better to think of this as numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7, but including leading zeros, so each number can be represented as a 3-digit number in base 7, except 343 which is 1000. Wait, no, because 343 is 7^3, so in base 7, it's 1 followed by three zeros, which is a 4-digit number. So, numbers from 0 to 342 in base 10 are 0 to 666 in base 7, which are 3-digit numbers. Then 343 is 1000 in base 7, which is a 4-digit number. So, perhaps the problem is considering numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which includes numbers up to 1000 in base 7. So, I need to count how many numbers from 1 to 343 (base 10) have at least one digit 4 or 5 when written in base 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 7, which would be numbers from 1 to 343 in base 7, but that seems like a different interpretation. Wait, no, because 343 in base 7 is 3*7^2 + 4*7 + 3 = 3*49 + 4*7 + 3 = 147 + 28 + 3 = 178 in base 10. But that's not correct because 343 in base 7 is actually 3*49 + 4*7 + 3 = 147 + 28 + 3 = 178. So, that can't be right because 343 in base 7 is 178 in base 10. But in base 10, 343 is 343, which is 7^3. So, perhaps the problem is about numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, converted to base 7, and we need to count how many of those have at least one digit 4 or 5 in their base 7 representation.\n\nSo, to approach this, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of numbers minus the number of numbers that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit. So, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is equal to the total numbers minus the numbers that have no 4s and no 5s.\n\nSo, first, how many numbers are we considering? The problem says the 343 smallest positive integers. So, that would be from 1 to 343 in base 10. So, total numbers = 343.\n\nNow, how many numbers in this range, when written in base 7, have no 4s and no 5s? So, each digit in base 7 can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. But if we exclude 4 and 5, then each digit can only be 0,1,2,3,6. So, for each digit, there are 5 possible choices.\n\nBut wait, in base 7, the digits are from 0 to 6, and each number can be represented with up to 4 digits in base 7 (since 7^3 = 343). So, numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 correspond to numbers from 1 to 1000 in base 7.\n\nSo, to count how many numbers from 1 to 343 (base 10) have no 4s and no 5s in their base 7 representation, we can consider each digit position separately.\n\nLet's think of each number as a 4-digit number in base 7, with leading zeros allowed. So, numbers from 0000 to 6666 in base 7, which correspond to 0 to 7^4 - 1 = 2401 in base 10. But we only need up to 343, which is 1000 in base 7. So, perhaps it's better to consider numbers with up to 4 digits in base 7, but only up to 1000 (base 7). Hmm, this might complicate things because the number of digits varies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the numbers as 3-digit numbers in base 7, since 7^3 = 343, and then include 343 itself as a separate case. But wait, 343 in base 7 is 1000, which is a 4-digit number. So, perhaps it's better to consider numbers from 0000 to 6666 in base 7, but only up to 1000 (base 7), which is 343 in base 10. But this might complicate the counting because the number of digits varies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider numbers with 1 digit, 2 digits, 3 digits, and 4 digits in base 7 separately.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, numbers with 1 digit in base 7: 1 to 6. So, how many of these have no 4 or 5? The digits allowed are 0,1,2,3,6. But since we're considering positive integers, from 1 to 6. So, numbers without 4 or 5 would be 1,2,3,6. So, 4 numbers.\n\nWait, but in base 7, the 1-digit numbers are 1 to 6, so 6 numbers. The numbers without 4 or 5 are 1,2,3,6: 4 numbers. So, the count for 1-digit numbers without 4 or 5 is 4.\n\nNext, 2-digit numbers in base 7: from 10 (base 7) which is 7 in base 10, up to 66 (base 7) which is 6*7 + 6 = 48 in base 10. So, total 2-digit numbers in base 7: 6*7 = 42 numbers.\n\nBut wait, from 10 to 66 in base 7, which is 7 to 48 in base 10, but we're considering up to 343 in base 10, so 48 is less than 343, so all 2-digit numbers in base 7 are included in our range.\n\nNow, for 2-digit numbers in base 7, how many have no 4 or 5 in any digit?\n\nEach digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. But the first digit (the 7's place) can't be 0 because it's a 2-digit number. So, first digit: 1,2,3,6 (4 choices). Second digit: 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So, total 4*5 = 20 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but in base 7, the first digit can't be 0, so yes, 4 choices for first digit, 5 for second digit.\n\nSo, 20 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, for 3-digit numbers in base 7: from 100 (base 7) which is 49 in base 10, up to 666 (base 7) which is 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342 in base 10. So, 3-digit numbers in base 7 go up to 342 in base 10, which is just before 343.\n\nNow, how many 3-digit numbers in base 7 have no 4 or 5 in any digit?\n\nFirst digit: 1,2,3,6 (4 choices). Second digit: 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). Third digit: same as second digit, 5 choices. So, total 4*5*5 = 100 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check: 4 choices for first digit, 5 for second, 5 for third: 4*5*5=100.\n\nSo, 100 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nNow, for 4-digit numbers in base 7: the only number we need to consider is 1000 (base 7), which is 343 in base 10. So, does 1000 in base 7 have any 4 or 5? Well, it's 1 followed by three 0s, so no 4 or 5. So, it's a number without 4 or 5. So, that's 1 number.\n\nWait, but is 1000 included in our range? The problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so 1 to 343 in base 10. So, yes, 343 is included, which is 1000 in base 7. So, we need to consider it.\n\nSo, for 4-digit numbers in base 7, only 1000 is within our range, and it doesn't contain 4 or 5. So, 1 number without 4 or 5.\n\nSo, now, total numbers without 4 or 5 in any digit in base 7 from 1 to 343 (base 10) would be:\n\n1-digit: 4\n\n2-digit: 20\n\n3-digit: 100\n\n4-digit: 1\n\nTotal = 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nWait, but let me check that.\n\nWait, 1-digit numbers: 1 to 6, 6 numbers. Without 4 or 5: 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: 7 to 48, 42 numbers. Without 4 or 5: 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit numbers: 49 to 342, 294 numbers. Without 4 or 5: 4*5*5=100.\n\n4-digit number: 343, 1 number. Without 4 or 5: 1.\n\nSo, total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 +1 = 125.\n\nSo, total numbers from 1 to 343: 343.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nWait, for 1-digit numbers, 1 to 6: without 4 or 5, it's 1,2,3,6: 4 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So, 4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5), third digit same as second (5). So, 4*5*5=100.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: only 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in base 10, and it doesn't have 4 or 5. So, 1 number.\n\nSo, total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 +1=125.\n\nSo, 343 total numbers, 125 without 4 or 5, so 343 - 125=218.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nWait, in base 7, the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 correspond to 1 to 1000 in base 7.\n\nSo, the total number of numbers is 343.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: for each digit, possible digits are 0,1,2,3,6.\n\nBut for numbers with leading zeros, like 001, but we're only considering positive integers, so numbers from 1 to 343, so leading zeros aren't considered as separate numbers.\n\nWait, but in my previous counting, I considered 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers, making sure that leading digits aren't zero.\n\nSo, the count seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the total number of numbers without 4 or 5:\n\n1-digit: 4\n\n2-digit: 4*5=20\n\n3-digit:4*5*5=100\n\n4-digit:1\n\nTotal: 125.\n\nSo, 343 - 125=218.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe I can model this as a 3-digit number in base 7, allowing leading zeros, so from 000 to 666 in base 7, which is 343 numbers in base 10 (from 0 to 342). Then, 343 is 1000 in base 7, which is outside this range, so maybe I should include it separately.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's the 343 smallest positive integers, so 1 to 343 in base 10, which includes 343, which is 1000 in base 7.\n\nSo, perhaps I should consider numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7 (which is 0 to 342 in base 10) and then 1000 in base 7 (343 in base 10).\n\nSo, for numbers from 0 to 342 in base 10, which is 000 to 666 in base 7, the count without 4 or 5 would be:\n\nFor each digit, 5 choices (0,1,2,3,6). But since we're including 0, the total numbers would be 5^3=125. But wait, that includes 000, which is 0 in base 10. But we're considering positive integers from 1 to 343, so we need to subtract 1 for the 000 case.\n\nWait, so from 000 to 666 in base 7, there are 5^3=125 numbers without 4 or 5, including 000. So, from 1 to 342, it would be 125 -1=124 numbers without 4 or 5. Then, adding 343, which is 1000 in base 7, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so total without 4 or 5 would be 124 +1=125, which matches my previous count.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, total numbers without 4 or 5:125.\n\nTotal numbers:343.\n\nSo, numbers with at least one 4 or 5:343 -125=218.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier when considering 4-digit numbers. Because 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, and it's the only 4-digit number in our range. So, when I included it in the count, it added 1 more to the numbers without 4 or 5, making it 125. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the count for numbers without 4 or 5:\n\nFor numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10, which are 001 to 666 in base 7, how many have no 4 or 5?\n\nEach digit can be 0,1,2,3,6, so 5 choices per digit.\n\nBut since we're excluding leading zeros, for 1-digit numbers: 4 choices (1,2,3,6).\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: first digit 4 choices, second digit 5 choices:4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers:4*5*5=100.\n\nSo, total without 4 or 5 from 1 to 342:4+20+100=124.\n\nThen, 343 is 1000 in base 7, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so total without 4 or 5:124+1=125.\n\nSo, 343 total numbers, 125 without 4 or 5, so 343-125=218.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to calculate this?\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 or 5 appears.\n\nBut that might be more complicated because digits can overlap.\n\nAlternatively, using inclusion-exclusion, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is equal to total numbers minus numbers with no 4s and no 5s, which is what I did.\n\nSo, I think the approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with smaller numbers to see if the approach works.\n\nSuppose we consider numbers from 1 to 7 in base 10, which is 1 to 10 in base 7.\n\nHow many numbers from 1 to 7 in base 10 have at least one 4 or 5",

But wait, the problem is about base 7, so I think it's referring to the numbers from 1 up to 343 in base 10, but when converted to base 7, how many of those numbers have at least one digit that's either 4 or 5.

But the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so maybe it's up to 343, which is 1000 in base 7, but including that? Hmm, but 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, so maybe the problem is considering numbers from 1 to 343 (base 10) and converting them to base 7, then counting how many have at least one 4 or 5 in their digits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about numbers in base 7 up to 343, but that seems conflicting because 343 in base 10 is 1000 in base 7, so the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 correspond to 1 to 1000 in base 7. So, the problem is asking how many numbers from 1 to 343 (base 10) when written in base 7 have at least one digit that's 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but 343 is 7^3, so in base 7, it's a 4-digit number: 1 0 0 0. So, the numbers we're considering are all 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers in base 7 up to 1000 (base 7). So, perhaps it's better to think of this as numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7, but including leading zeros, so each number can be represented as a 3-digit number in base 7, except 343 which is 1000. Wait, no, because 343 is 7^3, so in base 7, it's 1 followed by three zeros, which is a 4-digit number. So, numbers from 0 to 342 in base 10 are 0 to 666 in base 7, which are 3-digit numbers. Then 343 is 1000 in base 7, which is a 4-digit number. So, perhaps the problem is considering numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, which includes numbers up to 1000 in base 7.

Wait, no, because 343 in base 7 is 3*7^2 + 4*7 + 3 = 3*49 + 4*7 + 3 = 147 + 28 + 3 = 178 in base 10. But that's not correct because 343 in base 7 is actually 3*49 + 4*7 + 3 = 147 + 28 + 3 = 178. So, that can't be right because 343 in base 7 is 178 in base 10. But in base 10, 343 is 343, which is 7^3.

The problem says the 343 smallest positive integers. So, that would be from 1 to 343 in base 10. So, total numbers = 343.\n\nNow, how many numbers in this range, when written in base 7, have no 4s and no 5s? So, each digit in base 7 can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. But if we exclude 4 and 5, then each digit can only be 0,1,2,3,6. So, for each digit, there are 5 possible choices.\n\nBut wait, in base 7, the digits are from 0 to 6, and each number can be represented with up to 4 digits in base 7 (since 7^3 = 343).

But wait, 343 in base 7 is 1000, which is a 4-digit number. So, perhaps it's better to consider numbers from 0000 to 6666 in base 7, but only up to 1000 (base 7), which is 343 in base 10. But this might complicate the counting because the number of digits varies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider numbers with 1 digit, 2 digits, 3 digits, and 4 digits in base 7 separately.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, numbers with 1 digit in base 7: 1 to 6. So, how many of these have no 4 or 5? The digits allowed are 0,1,2,3,6. But since we're considering positive integers, from 1 to 6. So, numbers without 4 or 5 would be 1,2,3,6. So, 4 numbers.\n\nWait, but in base 7, the 1-digit numbers are 1 to 6, so 6 numbers. The numbers without 4 or 5 are 1,2,3,6: 4 numbers. So, the count for 1-digit numbers without 4 or 5 is 4.\n\nNext, 2-digit numbers in base 7: from 10 (base 7) which is 7 in base 10, up to 66 (base 7) which is 6*7 + 6 = 48 in base 10. So, total 2-digit numbers in base 7: 6*7 = 42 numbers.\n\nBut wait, from 10 to 66 in base 7, which is 7 to 48 in base 10, but we're considering up to 343 in base 10, so 48 is less than 343, so all 2-digit numbers in base 7 are included in our range.\n\nNow, for 2-digit numbers in base 7, how many have no 4 or 5 in any digit?\n\nEach digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. But the first digit (the 7's place) can't be 0 because it's a 2-digit number. So, first digit: 1,2,3,6 (4 choices). Second digit: 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So, total 4*5 = 20 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nWait, but in base 7, the first digit can't be 0, so yes, 4 choices for first digit, 5 for second digit.\n\nSo, 20 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, for 3-digit numbers in base 7: from 100 (base 7) which is 49 in base 10, up to 666 (base 7) which is 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342 in base 10. So, 3-digit numbers in base 7 go up to 342 in base 10, which is just before 343.\n\nNow, how many 3-digit numbers in base 7 have no 4 or 5 in any digit?\n\nFirst digit: 1,2,3,6 (4 choices). Second digit: 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). Third digit: same as second digit, 5 choices. So, total 4*5*5 = 100 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check: 4 choices for first digit, 5 for second, 5 for third: 4*5*5=100.\n\nSo, 100 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nNow, for 4-digit numbers in base 7: the only number we need to consider is 1000 (base 7), which is 343 in base 10. So, does 1000 in base 7 have any 4 or 5? Well, it's 1 followed by three 0s, so no 4 or 5. So, it's a number without 4 or 5. So, that's 1 number.\n\nWait, but is 1000 included in our range? The problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so 1 to 343 in base 10. So, yes, 343 is included, which is 1000 in base 7. So, we need to consider it.\n\nSo, for 4-digit numbers in base 7, only 1000 is within our range, and it doesn't contain 4 or 5. So, 1 number without 4 or 5.\n\nSo, now, total numbers without 4 or 5 in any digit in base 7 from 1 to 343 (base 10) would be:\n\n1-digit: 4\n\n2-digit: 20\n\n3-digit: 100\n\n4-digit: 1\n\nTotal = 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nWait, but let me check that.\n\nWait, 1-digit numbers: 1 to 6, 6 numbers. Without 4 or 5: 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: 7 to 48, 42 numbers. Without 4 or 5: 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit numbers: 49 to 342, 294 numbers. Without 4 or 5: 4*5*5=100.\n\n4-digit number: 343, 1 number. Without 4 or 5: 1.\n\nSo, total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 +1 = 125.\n\nSo, total numbers from 1 to 343: 343.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: 125.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nWait, for 1-digit numbers, 1 to 6: without 4 or 5, it's 1,2,3,6: 4 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 choices), second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 choices). So, 4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5), third digit same as second (5). So, 4*5*5=100.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers: only 1000 in base 7, which is 343 in base 10, and it doesn't have 4 or 5. So, 1 number.\n\nSo, total without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 +1=125.\n\nSo, 343 total numbers, 125 without 4 or 5, so 343 - 125=218.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nWait, in base 7, the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 correspond to 1 to 1000 in base 7.\n\nSo, the total number of numbers is 343.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: for each digit, possible digits are 0,1,2,3,6.\n\nBut for numbers with leading zeros, like 001, but we're only considering positive integers, so numbers from 1 to 343, so leading zeros aren't considered as separate numbers.\n\nWait, but in my previous counting, I considered 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers, making sure that leading digits aren't zero.\n\nSo, the count seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the total number of numbers without 4 or 5:\n\n1-digit: 4\n\n2-digit: 4*5=20\n\n3-digit:4*5*5=100\n\n4-digit:1\n\nTotal: 125.\n\nSo, 343 - 125=218.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe I can model this as a 3-digit number in base 7, allowing leading zeros, so from 000 to 666 in base 7, which is 343 numbers in base 10 (from 0 to 342). Then, 343 is 1000 in base 7, which is outside this range, so maybe I should include it separately.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's the 343 smallest positive integers, so 1 to 343 in base 10, which includes 343, which is 1000 in base 7.\n\nSo, perhaps I should consider numbers from 000 to 666 in base 7 (which is 0 to 342 in base 10) and then 1000 in base 7 (343 in base 10).\n\nSo, for numbers from 0 to 342 in base 10, which is 000 to 666 in base 7, the count without 4 or 5 would be:\n\nFor each digit, 5 choices (0,1,2,3,6). But since we're including 0, the total numbers would be 5^3=125. But wait, that includes 000, which is 0 in base 10. But we're considering positive integers from 1 to 343, so we need to subtract 1 for the 000 case.\n\nWait, so from 000 to 666 in base 7, there are 5^3=125 numbers without 4 or 5, including 000. So, from 1 to 342, it would be 125 -1=124 numbers without 4 or 5. Then, adding 343, which is 1000 in base 7, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so total without 4 or 5 would be 124 +1=125, which matches my previous count.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, total numbers without 4 or 5:125.\n\nTotal numbers:343.\n\nSo, numbers with at least one 4 or 5:343 -125=218.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier when considering 4-digit numbers. Because 1000 in base 7 is 343 in base 10, and it's the only 4-digit number in our range. So, when I included it in the count, it added 1 more to the numbers without 4 or 5, making it 125. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the count for numbers without 4 or 5:\n\nFor numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10, which are 001 to 666 in base 7, how many have no 4 or 5?\n\nEach digit can be 0,1,2,3,6, so 5 choices per digit.\n\nBut since we're excluding leading zeros, for 1-digit numbers: 4 choices (1,2,3,6).\n\nFor 2-digit numbers: first digit 4 choices, second digit 5 choices:4*5=20.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers:4*5*5=100.\n\nSo, total without 4 or 5 from 1 to 342:4+20+100=124.\n\nThen, 343 is 1000 in base 7, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so total without 4 or 5:124+1=125.\n\nSo, 343 total numbers, 125 without 4 or 5, so 343-125=218.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to calculate this?\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 or 5 appears.\n\nBut that might be more complicated because digits can overlap.\n\nAlternatively, using inclusion-exclusion, the number of numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is equal to total numbers minus numbers with no 4s and no 5s, which is what I did.\n\nSo, I think the approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with smaller numbers to see if the approach works.\n\nSuppose we consider numbers from 1 to 7 in base 10, which is 1 to 10 in base 7.\n\nHow many numbers from 1 to 7 in base 10 have at least one 4 or 5",

So, we're dealing with numbers from 1 to 7^3 - 1, which is 342, but wait, 343 is 7^3, so maybe the numbers go up to 343 in base 10, but in base 7, 343 would be represented as 1000_7. Hmm, so maybe the 343 numbers include 1 up to 666_7 because 666_7 is 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342, and then 343 would be 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number. So, perhaps the 343 numbers are from 1 to 342 in base 10, which would be 1 to 666_7 in base 7.\n\nWait, no, the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers. So, 1 to 343 inclusive. But 343 in base 7 is 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number. So, the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 would be represented in base 7 as 1_7 to 1000_7. So, how many digits do these numbers have in base 7?\n\nWell, in base 7, the number of digits needed to represent a number depends on its size. The maximum number is 343, which is 1000_7, a 4-digit number. So, the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 would be represented in base 7 as 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, or 4-digit numbers.\n\nBut wait, 343 is 7^3, so numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10 would be 1 to 666_7, which is a 3-digit number in base 7. So, 343 would be 1000_7. So, maybe the 343 numbers include 1 up to 343, which would include 1000_7. So, the numbers we're considering are from 1 to 343 in base 10, which is 1 to 1000_7 in base 7.\n\nBut when considering digits, 1000_7 is a 4-digit number, while all others up to 342 are 3-digit or fewer. So, perhaps I should consider all numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, and for each, write them in base 7, and count how many have at least one digit that is 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the total numbers and subtract those that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit. That is, use complementary counting. So, total numbers = 343. Numbers without any 4 or 5 in their base 7 representation would have digits only from {0,1,2,3,6} in each digit. But wait, in base 7, digits go from 0 to 6, so if we exclude 4 and 5, the allowed digits are 0,1,2,3,6. But wait, 6 is allowed, but 4 and 5 are excluded.\n\nWait, but in the problem, we're considering positive integers, so leading zeros are not allowed. So, when counting numbers without 4 or 5, each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6, but the first digit cannot be zero because we're dealing with positive integers.\n\nSo, perhaps I can model this as follows:\n\nThe number of n-digit numbers in base 7 without any 4 or 5 would be:\n\n- For 1-digit numbers: the digits can be 1,2,3,6 (since 0 is not allowed for positive integers). So, 4 options.\n\n- For 2-digit numbers: the first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), and the second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So, 4*5=20 options.\n\n- For 3-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 options each. So, 4*5*5=100 options.\n\n- For 4-digit numbers: only 1000_7 is within our range (since 343 is 1000_7). So, that's just 1 number, but does it contain 4 or 5? 1000_7 has digits 1,0,0,0, so no 4 or 5. So, it's a number without 4 or 5. So, 1 option.\n\nWait, but wait: in base 7, the number 1000_7 is 343 in base 10, which is included in our count of 343 numbers. So, when calculating the total numbers without 4 or 5, we need to include this 4-digit number as well.\n\nSo, the total numbers without any 4 or 5 would be:\n\n1-digit: 4\n\n2-digit: 20\n\n3-digit: 100\n\n4-digit: 1 (only 1000_7)\n\nSo, total without 4 or 5 is 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nWait, but wait: 4 + 20 is 24, plus 100 is 124, plus 1 is 125. So, total numbers without 4 or 5 is 125.\n\nBut wait, does 1000_7 count as a number without 4 or 5? Yes, because its digits are 1,0,0,0, so no 4 or 5.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 1000_7 is included in the 343 numbers. Since the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which would be from 1 to 343 inclusive. So, yes, 343 is included, which is 1000_7.\n\nSo, the total numbers without 4 or 5 is 125, as calculated.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers that do have at least one 4 or 5 is total numbers minus those without, which is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with leading zeros, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nFirst, how many 1-digit numbers without 4 or 5: digits allowed are 1,2,3,6. So, 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So, 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 each, so 4*5*5=100.\n\n4-digit numbers: only 1000_7, which is 343 in base 10, so 1 number.\n\nTotal without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nThus, total numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Are there any other 4-digit numbers in base 7 within 343? No, because 1000_7 is 343, and the next number would be 1001_7, which is 344, which is beyond our range. So, only 1000_7 is a 4-digit number in our range.\n\nBut wait, another thought: when counting 3-digit numbers in base 7, the maximum is 666_7, which is 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342. So, 343 is 1000_7, which is outside the 3-digit range.\n\nSo, the numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10 correspond to 1_7 to 666_7 in base 7, which are 1 to 3-digit numbers. Then, 343 is 1000_7, a 4-digit number.\n\nSo, when counting numbers without 4 or 5, we have:\n\n1-digit: 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit: 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit: 4*5*5=100.\n\n4-digit: 1 number (1000_7).\n\nTotal: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nThus, the count is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is 343 included in the count? The problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which would be 1 to 343 inclusive. So yes, 343 is included, and as we saw, it's 1000_7, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so it's counted in the 125, so when subtracting, it's correctly excluded from the 218.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: maybe we can calculate the number of numbers with 4 or 5 in their digits directly, using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nBut perhaps the complementary counting is the easier way, as done above.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check the count of numbers without 4 or 5 again.\n\n1-digit numbers: 1,2,3,6 \u2192 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options) \u2192 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 each \u2192 4*5*5=100.\n\n4-digit numbers: only 1000_7, which is allowed, so 1 number.\n\nTotal: 4 + 20 + 100 +1=125.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether 0 is included. The problem says positive integers, so 0 is not included. So, in the 1-digit numbers, we don't include 0, which is correct.\n\nWait, another check: how many 3-digit numbers are there in base 7? From 100_7 to 666_7, which is 7^2 = 49 numbers. Wait, no: the number of 3-digit numbers in base 7 is 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6? No, wait, the count is (6 options for first digit, 7 for second, 7 for third) = 6*7*7=294 numbers. But wait, 666_7 is 342, so that's correct. So, 3-digit numbers in base 7 go up to 342, which is 666_7.\n\nWait, but in our count of numbers without 4 or 5, for 3-digit numbers, we have 4*5*5=100 numbers. So, 100 out of 294 3-digit numbers don't have 4 or 5. That seems plausible.\n\nSimilarly, 2-digit numbers: 49 numbers in base 7 (from 10_7 to 66_7, which is 49 in base 10). Wait, no: 2-digit numbers in base 7 are from 10_7 (which is 7 in base 10) to 66_7 (which is 6*7 + 6 = 48). So, 48 - 7 + 1 = 42 numbers. But in our count, we have 20 numbers without 4 or 5, which is 20 out of 42. That seems reasonable.\n\nWait, but in our calculation, we considered 2-digit numbers as 4*5=20, which is correct because first digit has 4 options, second has 5. So, 20 numbers without 4 or 5 in 2-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly, 1-digit numbers: 4 out of 6 (since digits are 1-6), so 4 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nSo, overall, the count seems correct.\n\nThus, the answer should be 218 numbers that use 4 or 5 or both as digits in their base 7 representation among the first 343 positive integers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many of the first 343 positive integers (when written in base 7) contain the digits 4 or 5 (or both), we can use complementary counting. \n\n1. **Total Numbers**: There are 343 numbers in total (from 1 to 343 inclusive).\n\n2. **Numbers Without 4 or 5**:\n   - **1-digit**: 4 numbers (1, 2, 3, 6).\n   - **2-digit**: 4 (first digit) * 5 (second digit) = 20 numbers.\n   - **3-digit**: 4 (first digit) * 5 (second digit) * 5 (third digit) = 100 numbers.\n   - **4-digit**: Only 1000_7 (which is 343 in base 10), so 1 number.\n\n3. **Total Without 4 or 5**: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125 numbers.\n\n4. **Numbers With 4 or 5**: 343 total - 125 without = 218 numbers.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{218}",

Problem: How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 or both. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be from 1 up to 343 in base 10, right? Because 343 is 7^3, so that makes sense. So, we're dealing with numbers from 1 to 7^3 - 1, which is 342, but wait, 343 is 7^3, so maybe the numbers go up to 343 in base 10, but in base 7, 343 would be represented as 1000_7. Hmm, so maybe the 343 numbers include 1 up to 666_7 because 666_7 is 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342, and then 343 would be 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number. So, perhaps the 343 numbers are from 1 to 342 in base 10, which would be 1 to 666_7 in base 7.\n\nWait, no, the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers. So, 1 to 343 inclusive. But 343 in base 7 is 1000_7, which is a 4-digit number. So, the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 would be represented in base 7 as 1_7 to 1000_7. So, how many digits do these numbers have in base 7?\n\nWell, in base 7, the number of digits needed to represent a number depends on its size. The maximum number is 343, which is 1000_7, a 4-digit number. So, the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10 would be represented in base 7 as 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, or 4-digit numbers.\n\nBut wait, 343 is 7^3, so numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10 would be 1 to 666_7, which is a 3-digit number in base 7. So, 343 would be 1000_7. So, maybe the 343 numbers include 1 up to 343, which would include 1000_7. So, the numbers we're considering are from 1 to 343 in base 10, which is 1 to 1000_7 in base 7.\n\nBut when considering digits, 1000_7 is a 4-digit number, while all others up to 342 are 3-digit or fewer. So, perhaps I should consider all numbers from 1 to 343 in base 10, and for each, write them in base 7, and count how many have at least one digit that is 4 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the total numbers and subtract those that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit. That is, use complementary counting. So, total numbers = 343. Numbers without any 4 or 5 in their base 7 representation would have digits only from {0,1,2,3,6} in each digit. But wait, in base 7, digits go from 0 to 6, so if we exclude 4 and 5, the allowed digits are 0,1,2,3,6. But wait, 6 is allowed, but 4 and 5 are excluded.\n\nWait, but in the problem, we're considering positive integers, so leading zeros are not allowed. So, when counting numbers without 4 or 5, each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6, but the first digit cannot be zero because we're dealing with positive integers.\n\nSo, perhaps I can model this as follows:\n\nThe number of n-digit numbers in base 7 without any 4 or 5 would be:\n\n- For 1-digit numbers: the digits can be 1,2,3,6 (since 0 is not allowed for positive integers). So, 4 options.\n\n- For 2-digit numbers: the first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), and the second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So, 4*5=20 options.\n\n- For 3-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 options each. So, 4*5*5=100 options.\n\n- For 4-digit numbers: only 1000_7 is within our range (since 343 is 1000_7). So, that's just 1 number, but does it contain 4 or 5? 1000_7 has digits 1,0,0,0, so no 4 or 5. So, it's a number without 4 or 5. So, 1 option.\n\nWait, but wait: in base 7, the number 1000_7 is 343 in base 10, which is included in our count of 343 numbers. So, when calculating the total numbers without 4 or 5, we need to include this 4-digit number as well.\n\nSo, the total numbers without any 4 or 5 would be:\n\n1-digit: 4\n\n2-digit: 20\n\n3-digit: 100\n\n4-digit: 1 (only 1000_7)\n\nSo, total without 4 or 5 is 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nWait, but wait: 4 + 20 is 24, plus 100 is 124, plus 1 is 125. So, total numbers without 4 or 5 is 125.\n\nBut wait, does 1000_7 count as a number without 4 or 5? Yes, because its digits are 1,0,0,0, so no 4 or 5.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 1000_7 is included in the 343 numbers. Since the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which would be from 1 to 343 inclusive. So, yes, 343 is included, which is 1000_7.\n\nSo, the total numbers without 4 or 5 is 125, as calculated.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers that do have at least one 4 or 5 is total numbers minus those without, which is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with leading zeros, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nFirst, how many 1-digit numbers without 4 or 5: digits allowed are 1,2,3,6. So, 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So, 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 each, so 4*5*5=100.\n\n4-digit numbers: only 1000_7, which is 343 in base 10, so 1 number.\n\nTotal without 4 or 5: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nThus, total numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Are there any other 4-digit numbers in base 7 within 343? No, because 1000_7 is 343, and the next number would be 1001_7, which is 344, which is beyond our range. So, only 1000_7 is a 4-digit number in our range.\n\nBut wait, another thought: when counting 3-digit numbers in base 7, the maximum is 666_7, which is 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342. So, 343 is 1000_7, which is outside the 3-digit range.\n\nSo, the numbers from 1 to 342 in base 10 correspond to 1_7 to 666_7 in base 7, which are 1 to 3-digit numbers. Then, 343 is 1000_7, a 4-digit number.\n\nSo, when counting numbers without 4 or 5, we have:\n\n1-digit: 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit: 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit: 4*5*5=100.\n\n4-digit: 1 number (1000_7).\n\nTotal: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125.\n\nThus, the count is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is 343 included in the count? The problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, which would be 1 to 343 inclusive. So yes, 343 is included, and as we saw, it's 1000_7, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so it's counted in the 125, so when subtracting, it's correctly excluded from the 218.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: maybe we can calculate the number of numbers with 4 or 5 in their digits directly, using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nBut perhaps the complementary counting is the easier way, as done above.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check the count of numbers without 4 or 5 again.\n\n1-digit numbers: 1,2,3,6 \u2192 4 numbers.\n\n2-digit numbers: first digit 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options) \u2192 4*5=20.\n\n3-digit numbers: first digit 4 options, second and third digits 5 each \u2192 4*5*5=100.\n\n4-digit numbers: only 1000_7, which is allowed, so 1 number.\n\nTotal: 4 + 20 + 100 +1=125.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total numbers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether 0 is included. The problem says positive integers, so 0 is not included. So, in the 1-digit numbers, we don't include 0, which is correct.\n\nWait, another check: how many 3-digit numbers are there in base 7? From 100_7 to 666_7, which is 7^2 = 49 numbers. Wait, no: the number of 3-digit numbers in base 7 is 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6? No, wait, the count is (6 options for first digit, 7 for second, 7 for third) = 6*7*7=294 numbers. But wait, 666_7 is 342, so that's correct. So, 3-digit numbers in base 7 go up to 342, which is 666_7.\n\nWait, but in our count of numbers without 4 or 5, for 3-digit numbers, we have 4*5*5=100 numbers. So, 100 out of 294 3-digit numbers don't have 4 or 5. That seems plausible.\n\nSimilarly, 2-digit numbers: 49 numbers in base 7 (from 10_7 to 66_7, which is 49 in base 10). Wait, no: 2-digit numbers in base 7 are from 10_7 (which is 7 in base 10) to 66_7 (which is 6*7 + 6 = 48). So, 48 - 7 + 1 = 42 numbers. But in our count, we have 20 numbers without 4 or 5, which is 20 out of 42. That seems reasonable.\n\nWait, but in our calculation, we considered 2-digit numbers as 4*5=20, which is correct because first digit has 4 options, second has 5. So, 20 numbers without 4 or 5 in 2-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly, 1-digit numbers: 4 out of 6 (since digits are 1-6), so 4 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nSo, overall, the count seems correct.\n\nThus, the answer should be 218 numbers that use 4 or 5 or both as digits in their base 7 representation among the first 343 positive integers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many of the first 343 positive integers (when written in base 7) contain the digits 4 or 5 (or both), we can use complementary counting. \n\n1. **Total Numbers**: There are 343 numbers in total (from 1 to 343 inclusive).\n\n2. **Numbers Without 4 or 5**:\n   - **1-digit**: 4 numbers (1, 2, 3, 6).\n   - **2-digit**: 4 (first digit) * 5 (second digit) = 20 numbers.\n   - **3-digit**: 4 (first digit) * 5 (second digit) * 5 (third digit) = 100 numbers.\n   - **4-digit**: Only 1000_7 (which is 343 in base 10), so 1 number.\n\n3. **Total Without 4 or 5**: 4 + 20 + 100 + 1 = 125 numbers.\n\n4. **Numbers With 4 or 5**: 343 total - 125 without = 218 numbers.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{218}",
