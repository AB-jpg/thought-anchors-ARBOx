Problem: How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many of the 343 smallest positive integers, when written in base 7, use the digits 4 or 5 or both. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, base 7 numbers. Base 7 digits go from 0 to 6, right? So each digit in a base 7 number can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The problem is asking about numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 in any of their digits. And we're considering the 343 smallest positive integers. Wait, 343... that's 7 cubed, right? So 7^3 = 343. That makes sense because in base 7, the numbers go from 1 up to 666_7, which is 342 in decimal. Wait, no, hold on. Actually, 666_7 is 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342. So the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be from 1 up to 666_7, which is 342 in decimal, and then the next number would be 1000_7, which is 343. But wait, the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so does that include 343 or go up to 342? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, 343 is 7^3, so in base 7, numbers with up to three digits go from 000_7 (which is 0) up to 666_7 (which is 342). So the numbers from 1 to 342 in decimal correspond to 1_7 up to 666_7 in base 7. Therefore, the 343 numbers would be from 1 to 343 in decimal, but 343 in decimal is 1000_7, which is a four-digit number in base 7. So perhaps the problem is considering numbers up to three digits in base 7, which is 342 in decimal, making the total 342 numbers. But the problem says 343 smallest positive integers. Hmm, maybe including 0? But it says positive integers, so 0 is excluded. So maybe it's from 1 to 343 in decimal, which includes 343 as 1000_7. But 1000_7 is a four-digit number, so perhaps the problem is considering numbers with up to three digits in base 7, which would be 342 numbers, but the problem says 343. I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers (including 0), but since it's positive integers, we exclude 0, making it 342. But the problem says 343 smallest positive integers, so maybe it includes 343 as 1000_7. Hmm, perhaps I need to proceed regardless and see if it makes a difference.\n\nSo, to find how many numbers in base 7 (from 1 to 343 in decimal, which is up to 1000_7) have at least one 4 or 5 in their digits. Alternatively, maybe it's from 1 to 666_7, which is 342, and the problem says 343, so maybe it's including 343 as well, which is 1000_7. But 1000_7 has digits 1 and 0s, so it doesn't have 4 or 5. So whether we include 343 or not, it doesn't affect the count. So perhaps the problem is considering numbers up to 666_7, which is 342, and the 343 numbers include 0, but since it's positive integers, we have to adjust. Hmm, this is a bit confusing, but maybe I can proceed by considering numbers with up to three digits in base 7, which is 1 to 666_7, and that's 342 numbers, but the problem says 343. Maybe the problem is considering numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, including 0, but since we're only interested in positive integers, we exclude 0, making it 342. But the problem says 343 smallest positive integers, so perhaps it's from 1 to 343 in decimal, which is 1 to 1000_7 in base 7. But 1000_7 is a four-digit number, so maybe the problem is considering up to three digits, making it 342 numbers, but the problem says 343. Hmm, maybe I should just proceed and see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then the number of positive integers would be 343 - 1 = 342. But the problem says 343 smallest positive integers, so perhaps it's considering numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, which includes 343 as 1000_7. So maybe I need to include that. But 1000_7 doesn't have 4 or 5, so including it or not doesn't affect the count. So perhaps I can proceed by considering all three-digit numbers in base 7, from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract 1 for the number 0, making it 342 positive integers. But the problem says 343, so maybe it's including 343 as 1000_7, which is a four-digit number, but since it's beyond three digits, maybe it's better to consider only three-digit numbers. Hmm, perhaps I should just proceed with three-digit numbers and see.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model the problem as counting the numbers from 1 to 342 (since 343 is 7^3, and 342 is 666_7). So the numbers are from 1 to 342 in decimal, which correspond to 1_7 to 666_7 in base 7. So there are 342 numbers. But the problem says 343, so perhaps it's including 343, but as I said, 343 is 1000_7, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so whether we include it or not, the count remains the same. So perhaps I can proceed by considering numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract 1 to exclude 0, making it 342 positive integers. But the problem says 343, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just proceed with three-digit base 7 numbers, including leading zeros, so from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract the count of numbers that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit, which would give me the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5. But since the problem is about positive integers, I need to exclude 0, so maybe subtract 1 from the total. Wait, no, because when I calculate the total numbers without 4 or 5, I can include 0 and then subtract it at the end.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of numbers is 343, including 0. The number of numbers that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit is 5^3 = 125, because each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. So 5 choices per digit, three digits, so 5*5*5=125. Therefore, the number of numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218. But wait, that's including 0. Since the problem is about positive integers, we need to subtract 1 if 0 is included in the count. So 218 - 1 = 217. But wait, does 0 have a 4 or 5? No, so if we include 0 in the 343, then the count of numbers without 4 or 5 is 125, which includes 0. Therefore, the count of positive integers without 4 or 5 is 125 - 1 = 124. Therefore, the count of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218, but since we're considering positive integers, which are 343 - 1 = 342 numbers, then the count would be 342 - 124 = 218. Wait, that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nTotal numbers from 000_7 to 666_7: 343 numbers (including 0).\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6. So 5 choices per digit. So 5^3 = 125 numbers, including 0.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.\n\nBut the problem is about positive integers, so we need to exclude 0. So the total positive integers considered are 343 - 1 = 342.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5 among positive integers: 125 - 1 = 124 (since 0 is excluded).\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5 among positive integers: 342 - 124 = 218.\n\nSo the answer would be 218.\n\nWait, but let me check this again.\n\nTotal numbers in base 7 up to three digits: 7^3 = 343, including 0.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: 5^3 = 125, including 0.\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218, including 0.\n\nBut since we're considering positive integers, we need to subtract 1 if 0 is included in the count. Wait, but 0 is not a positive integer, so when we consider positive integers, the total is 343 - 1 = 342.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5 among positive integers: 125 - 1 = 124 (since 0 is excluded).\n\nTherefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 342 - 124 = 218.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each digit can be 0-6, but for positive integers, the first digit can't be 0. Wait, no, because in the range from 1 to 342, numbers can have leading zeros when represented as three-digit numbers in base 7, but they're still considered as numbers without leading zeros. Hmm, maybe that complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider numbers with 1, 2, or 3 digits in base 7, and calculate the count for each case.\n\nSo, for 1-digit numbers in base 7: 1 to 6.\n\nNumbers that have 4 or 5: 4 and 5, so 2 numbers.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers in base 7: from 10_7 (which is 7 in decimal) to 66_7 (which is 48 in decimal).\n\nEach digit can be 0-6, but the first digit is 1-6, and the second digit is 0-6.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So 4*5 = 20 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nTotal 2-digit numbers: 6*7 = 42.\n\nSo numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 42 - 20 = 22.\n\nFor 3-digit numbers in base 7: from 100_7 (49 in decimal) to 666_7 (342 in decimal).\n\nEach digit: first digit 1-6, second and third digits 0-6.\n\nNumbers without 4 or 5: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options), third digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options). So 4*5*5 = 100 numbers without 4 or 5.\n\nTotal 3-digit numbers: 6*7*7 = 294.\n\nNumbers with at least one 4 or 5: 294 - 100 = 194.\n\nNow, adding up the numbers from 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit:\n\n1-digit: 2\n\n2-digit: 22\n\n3-digit: 194\n\nTotal: 2 + 22 + 194 = 218.\n\nYes, that matches the previous result. So the answer is 218.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\n1-digit: 4 and 5, so 2 numbers. Correct.\n\n2-digit numbers: total is 6*7=42. Numbers without 4 or 5: first digit 4 options (1,2,3,6), second digit 5 options (0,1,2,3,6). So 4*5=20. Therefore, 42-20=22. Correct.\n\n3-digit numbers: total is 6*7*7=294. Numbers without 4 or 5: 4*5*5=100. So 294-100=194. Correct.\n\nTotal: 2+22+194=218.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the inclusion-exclusion principle for three-digit numbers, considering each digit, but that might complicate things more.\n\nWait, another way: for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 or 5 appears.\n\nBut that might be more complex because numbers can have multiple digits with 4 or 5, leading to overcounting.\n\nSo, the method of total minus numbers without 4 or 5 seems more straightforward and accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 218.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of integers is \\boxed{218}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n1. **Total numbers considered**: The 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 correspond to numbers from 1 to 342 in decimal, which are represented as 1_7 to 666_7 in base 7. Including 0, there are 343 numbers (from 000_7 to 666_7).\n\n2. **Numbers without 4 or 5**: Each digit in a base 7 number can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 6. Thus, for each digit, there are 5 choices.

    "Actually, 666_7 is 6*7^2 + 6*7 + 6 = 6*49 + 6*7 + 6 = 294 + 42 + 6 = 342.",
    "So the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7 would be from 1 up to 666_7, which is 342 in decimal, and then the next number would be 1000_7, which is 343.",
    "But wait, the problem says the 343 smallest positive integers, so does that include 343 or go up to 342?",
    "Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.",
    "Wait, 343 is 7^3, so in base 7, numbers with up to three digits go from 000_7 (which is 0) up to 666_7 (which is 342).",
    "So the numbers from 1 to 342 in decimal correspond to 1_7 up to 666_7 in base 7.",
    "Therefore, the 343 numbers would be from 1 to 343 in decimal, but 343 in decimal is 1000_7, which is a four-digit number in base 7.",
    "So perhaps the problem is considering numbers up to three digits in base 7, which is 342 in decimal, making the total 342 numbers.",
    "But the problem says 343 smallest positive integers.",
    "Hmm, maybe including 0?",
    "But it says positive integers, so 0 is excluded.",
    "So maybe it's from 1 to 343 in decimal, which includes 343 as 1000_7.",
    "But 1000_7 is a four-digit number, so perhaps the problem is considering numbers with up to three digits in base 7, which would be 342 numbers, but the problem says 343.",
    "I'm a bit confused here.",
    "Wait, maybe the problem is considering numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers (including 0), but since it's positive integers, we exclude 0, making it 342.",
    "But the problem says 343 smallest positive integers, so maybe it includes 343 as 1000_7.",
    "Hmm, perhaps I need to proceed regardless and see if it makes a difference.",
    "So, to find how many numbers in base 7 (from 1 to 343 in decimal, which is up to 1000_7) have at least one 4 or 5 in their digits.",
    "Alternatively, maybe it's from 1 to 666_7, which is 342, and the problem says 343, so maybe it's including 343 as well, which is 1000_7.",
    "But 1000_7 has digits 1 and 0s, so it doesn't have 4 or 5.",
    "So whether we include 343 or not, it doesn't affect the count.",
    "So perhaps the problem is considering numbers up to 666_7, which is 342, and the 343 numbers include 0, but since it's positive integers, we have to adjust.",
    "Hmm, this is a bit confusing, but maybe I can proceed by considering numbers with up to three digits in base 7, which is 1 to 666_7, and that's 342 numbers, but the problem says 343.",
    "Maybe the problem is considering numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, including 0, but since we're only interested in positive integers, we exclude 0, making it 342.",
    "But the problem says 343 smallest positive integers, so perhaps it's from 1 to 343 in decimal, which is 1 to 1000_7 in base 7.",
    "But 1000_7 is a four-digit number, so maybe the problem is considering up to three digits, making it 342 numbers, but the problem says 343.",
    "Hmm, maybe I should just proceed and see.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then the number of positive integers would be 343 - 1 = 342.",
    "But the problem says 343 smallest positive integers, so perhaps it's considering numbers from 1 to 343 in decimal, which includes 343 as 1000_7.",
    "So maybe I need to include that.",
    "But 1000_7 doesn't have 4 or 5, so including it or not doesn't affect the count.",
    "So perhaps I can proceed by considering all three-digit numbers in base 7, from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract 1 for the number 0, making it 342 positive integers.",
    "But the problem says 343, so maybe it's including 343 as 1000_7, which is a four-digit number, but since it's beyond three digits, maybe it's better to consider only three-digit numbers.",
    "Hmm, perhaps I should just proceed with three-digit numbers and see.",
    "Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the problem as counting the numbers from 1 to 342 (since 343 is 7^3, and 342 is 666_7).",
    "So the numbers are from 1 to 342 in decimal, which correspond to 1_7 to 666_7 in base 7.",
    "So there are 342 numbers.",
    "But the problem says 343, so perhaps it's including 343, but as I said, 343 is 1000_7, which doesn't have 4 or 5, so whether we include it or not, the count remains the same.",
    "So perhaps I can proceed by considering numbers from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract 1 to exclude 0, making it 342 positive integers.",
    "But the problem says 343, so maybe I'm overcomplicating.",
    "Let me just proceed with three-digit base 7 numbers, including leading zeros, so from 000_7 to 666_7, which is 343 numbers, and then subtract the count of numbers that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit, which would give me the numbers that have at least one 4 or 5.",
    "But since the problem is about positive integers, I need to exclude 0, so maybe subtract 1 from the total.",
    "Wait, no, because when I calculate the total numbers without 4 or 5, I can include 0 and then subtract it at the end.",
    "Wait, perhaps it's better to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.",
    "The total number of numbers is 343, including 0.",
    "The number of numbers that don't have 4 or 5 in any digit is 5^3 = 125, because each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6.",
    "So 5 choices per digit, three digits, so 5*5*5=125.",
    "Therefore, the number of numbers that have at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218.",
    "But wait, that's including 0.",
    "Since the problem is about positive integers, we need to subtract 1 if 0 is included in the count.",
    "So 218 - 1 = 217.",
    "But wait, does 0 have a 4 or 5?",
    "No, so if we include 0 in the 343, then the count of numbers without 4 or 5 is 125, which includes 0.",
    "Therefore, the count of positive integers without 4 or 5 is 125 - 1 = 124.",
    "Therefore, the count of positive integers with at least one 4 or 5 is 343 - 125 = 218, but since we're considering positive integers, which are 343 - 1 = 342 numbers, then the count would be 342 - 124 = 218.",
    "Wait, that seems conflicting.",
    "Wait, let me clarify:",
    "Total numbers from 000_7 to 666_7: 343 numbers (including 0).",
    "Numbers without 4 or 5: each digit can be 0,1,2,3,6.",
    "So 5 choices per digit.",
    "So 5^3 = 125 numbers, including 0.",
    "Therefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218.",
    "But the problem is about positive integers, so we need to exclude 0.",
    "So the total positive integers considered are 343 - 1 = 342.",
    "Numbers without 4 or 5 among positive integers: 125 - 1 = 124 (since 0 is excluded).",
    "Therefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5 among positive integers: 342 - 124 = 218.",
    "So the answer would be 218.",
    "Wait, but let me check this again.",
    "Total numbers in base 7 up to three digits: 7^3 = 343, including 0.",
    "Numbers without 4 or 5: 5^3 = 125, including 0.",
    "Therefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 343 - 125 = 218, including 0.",
    "But since we're considering positive integers, we need to subtract 1 if 0 is included in the count.",
    "Wait, but 0 is not a positive integer, so when we consider positive integers, the total is 343 - 1 = 342.",
    "Numbers without 4 or 5 among positive integers: 125 - 1 = 124 (since 0 is excluded).",
    "Therefore, numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 342 - 124 = 218.",
    "Yes, that seems correct.",
    "Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each digit can be 0-6, but for positive integers, the first digit can't be 0.",
    "Wait, no, because in the range from 1 to 342, numbers can have leading zeros when represented as three-digit numbers in base 7, but they're still considered as numbers without leading zeros.",
    "Hmm, maybe that complicates things.",
    "Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider numbers with 1, 2, or 3 digits in base 7, and calculate the count for each case.",
    "So, for 1-digit numbers in base 7: 1 to 6.",
    "Numbers that have 4 or 5: 4 and 5, so 2 numbers.",
    "For 2-digit numbers in base 7: from 10_7 (which is 7 in decimal) to 66_7 (which is 48 in decimal).",
    "Each digit can be 0-6, but the first digit is 1-6, and the second digit is 0-6.",
    "Numbers without 4 or 5: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit can be 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options).",
    "So 4*5 = 20 numbers without 4 or 5.",
    "Total 2-digit numbers: 6*7 = 42.",
    "So numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 42 - 20 = 22.",
    "For 3-digit numbers in base 7: from 100_7 (49 in decimal) to 666_7 (342 in decimal).",
    "Each digit: first digit 1-6, second and third digits 0-6.",
    "Numbers without 4 or 5: first digit can be 1,2,3,6 (4 options), second digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options), third digit 0,1,2,3,6 (5 options).",
    "So 4*5*5 = 100 numbers without 4 or 5.",
    "Total 3-digit numbers: 6*7*7 = 294.",
    "Numbers with at least one 4 or 5: 294 - 100 = 194.",
    "Now, adding up the numbers from 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit:",
    "1-digit: 2",
    "2-digit: 22",
    "3-digit: 194",
    "Total: 2 + 22 + 194 = 218.",
    "Yes, that matches the previous result.",
    "So the answer is 218.",
    "But wait, let me double-check the calculations.",
    "1-digit: 4 and 5, so 2 numbers.",
    "Correct. 2-digit numbers: total is 6*7=42.",
    "Numbers without 4 or 5: first digit 4 options (1,2,3,6), second digit 5 options (0,1,2,3,6).",
    "So 4*5=20.",
    "Therefore, 42-20=22.",
    "Correct. 3-digit numbers: total is 6*7*7=294.",
    "Numbers without 4 or 5: 4*5*5=100.",
    "So 294-100=194.",
    "Correct. Total: 2+22+194=218.",
    "Yes, that seems correct.",
    "Alternatively, using the inclusion-exclusion principle for three-digit numbers, considering each digit, but that might complicate things more.",
    "Wait, another way: for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 or 5 appears.",
    "But that might be more complex because numbers can have multiple digits with 4 or 5, leading to overcounting.",
    "So, the method of total minus numbers without 4 or 5 seems more straightforward and accurate.",
    "Therefore, the answer is 218.",
    "**Final Answer**\nThe number of integers is \\boxed{218}."
